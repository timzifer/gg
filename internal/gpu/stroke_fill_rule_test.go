// TestStrokePath_SelfOverlapMatchesCPUStroker verifies that a stroke which
// overlaps itself renders through the GPU render context's queue exactly as
// SoftwareRenderer.Stroke renders it.
//
// preTessellateStroke expands the stroke once, at queue time, and the result
// is filled — on the GPU, or through dispatchDrawsToSoftware on a software
// adapter. The fill rule is what decides the overlaps: a tight zigzag's
// consecutive segments cover the same pixels near every turn, and an EvenOdd
// fill cancels those pixels into holes, while the CPU stroker fills the same
// expander output NonZero and covers them. Comparing the two pixel by pixel is
// what catches a fill rule that does not match, without needing a GPU.
