# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.52.5] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **Raster backend device scale preserved across draw operations** — `FillRect`,
  `setPath`, `SetClip`, and `SetTransform` called `ctx.Identity()` which reset the
  device `Scale(2,2)` set in `Begin()`. At 2x scale, content rendered in the
  top-left quadrant only (25% coverage). Fix: `applyDeviceScale()` replaces
  `Identity()` (Skia `fInitialCTM` pattern). `SetTransform` now composes device
  scale with recorded transform.

- **Recording DrawStringAnchored anchor offset** — `Recorder.DrawStringAnchored`
  and `StrokeStringAnchored` ignored `ax`/`ay` anchor parameters entirely. Text
  was drawn at raw `(x,y)` without offset. Fix: compute anchor offset at record
  time using `text.Measure` + face metrics, matching `Context.DrawStringAnchored`
  exactly (Skia pre-positioned `SkTextBlob` pattern). Pixel-perfect parity verified.

## [0.52.4] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **Recording raster backend: DrawText now renders text** — `DrawText` was a
  no-op because the font face was not stored in commands. Now `DrawTextCommand`
  carries `text.Face` (Go GC keeps font alive, matching Skia `sk_sp<SkTextBlob>`
  / Cairo `cairo_scaled_font_reference` pattern). Font size is scaled by the CTM
  at record time so playback in identity space renders at the correct size.

- **Recording raster backend: HiDPI scale support** — `NewBackendWithScale(scale)`
  creates an enlarged pixel buffer with uniform scale transform at playback time
  (matching Skia `fInitialCTM` composition / Cairo `replay_with_transform`).

- **Text-outline glyph cache collision between font faces** ([#514](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/514), @kivutar) —
  Font IDs now include the full face name, preventing regular and bold faces
  in the same family from sharing cached outlines. Font ID computation unified
  into `text.ComputeFontID` — single source of truth for CPU, MSDF, and glyph
  mask pipelines.

### Removed

- **Dead `internal/gpucore` abstraction layer** ([#518](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/518)) —
  Removed ~1,740 LOC of orphaned code (`gpucore/` package + `HALAdapter`).
  Planned as GPU abstraction for Vello compute but never adopted — production
  uses `*wgpu.Device`/`*wgpu.Queue` directly (Vello pattern).

### Changed

- deps: wgpu v0.31.4 → v0.31.6

## [0.52.3] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Platform font smoothing integration** ([#495](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/495), @besmpl) —
  `ggcanvas` now applies `PlatformProvider.FontSmoothing`: disabled smoothing
  selects `TextModeAliased`, grayscale disables LCD masks, and subpixel mode
  uses the reported RGB/BGR layout. Aliased mode now also preserves binary
  coverage for pre-shaped scene glyphs instead of routing them through the
  regular anti-aliased shaped-text pipeline.

### Fixed

- **NoAA curved strokes no longer collapse by 4x** ([#510](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/510), @lkmavi, [#509](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/509)) —
  `SetAntiAlias(false)` + `Stroke()` on circles/arcs displaced geometry (~335→~83 in X).
  Root cause: `curvePixelAccuracy()` unconditionally right-shifted by `kDefaultAccuracy=2`
  at `aaShift=0`. Fixed with `min(shift, kDefaultAccuracy)`. NoAA path now defaults to
  `flattenCurves=true` (Skia `SkScan::FillPath` pattern). Dropped unused error return
  from `fillNoAA`.

### Changed

- deps: gpucontext v0.27.0 → v0.28.0, wgpu v0.31.0 → v0.31.4, gputypes v0.5.1 → v0.5.2

## [0.52.2] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **Concurrent global text cache race** ([#494](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/494), @besmpl) —
  `globalGlyphCache` and `globalSubpixelCache` used bare pointer reads/writes.
  Replaced with `atomic.Pointer[T]` for lock-free thread safety.

- **Path bounds not preserved across Reset/Append/Clone** ([#497](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/497), @besmpl) —
  `Reset()` did not clear `boundsValid`, `Append()` did not merge bounds,
  `Clone()` did not copy bounds fields. Fixed all three operations.

- **Premultiplied alpha double-multiplication in scene renderer** ([#500](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/500), @besmpl) —
  `render/software.go` multiplied already-premultiplied source channels by alpha
  a second time, making semi-transparent fills appear darker than correct.

- **HiDPI layer and mask dimensions** ([#502](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/502), @besmpl) —
  `PushLayer`, `PushMaskLayer`, and `AsMask` used logical dimensions instead of
  physical (`PixelWidth`/`PixelHeight`), clipping content at non-1x device scales.

- **Transformed rectangular clips** ([#503](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/503), @besmpl) —
  `ClipRect` and `ClipRoundRect` transformed only two diagonal corners, producing
  axis-aligned bounding box clips under rotation/shear. Now transforms all four
  corners and uses a path clip for non-axis-aligned transforms.

- **Recording stroke rectangles under transforms** ([#498](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/498), @besmpl) —
  `StrokeRectangle` in the recording system used the same two-corner transform bug.
  Now transforms all four corners for non-translation transforms, with scaled
  stroke metrics matching direct rendering.

- **Recording clips were no-ops** ([#499](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/499), @besmpl) —
  Raster backend `SetClip` set the path but never called `Clip()`.
  `ClearClip` was empty. Also fixed mask clipper fill rule (was hardcoded
  even-odd), subpath separation, and Push/Pop clip state restoration.

- **Recording ClipRoundRect transform parity** — Playback `ClipRoundRectCommand`
  now matches `Context.ClipRoundRect` for non-uniform/non-axis-aligned transforms
  (interaction fix between #499 and #503).

## [0.52.1] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **Remove orphaned gogpu/ui dependency from go.mod** — `tmp/` test scripts without own `go.mod` caused `go mod tidy` to pull `gogpu` and `ui` into gg's module graph. gg is a pure drawing library and must not depend on gogpu or ui. Users doing `go get github.com/gogpu/gg@v0.52.0` were pulling unnecessary transitive dependencies.

### Changed

- **docs:** ARCHITECTURE.md updated for ADR-065/066/067 — compositor delegation section, damage pipeline Level 3/4

## [0.52.0] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **Compositor architecture migration** (ADR-067, gg#493) — gg becomes a pure drawing library. Surface-level compositor decisions (LoadOp, damage scissoring, MSAA overlay compositing) delegated to gogpu via `SurfaceCompositor` interface.
  - `preserveContent` removed from `GPURenderSession` — compositor decides LoadOp
  - `shouldPreserveSurface()` simplified to gg-internal multi-pass only
  - `selectBaseLayer` uses `target.PreserveContent` (explicit external content signal), not `frameRendered`
  - Per-frame compositor via `GPURenderTarget.Compositor` field (enterprise pattern: compositor context per render call)
  - `MarkFrameRendered()` replaces `preserveContent` flag for compositor → gg signal
  - MSAA overlay compositing delegates to `SurfaceCompositor.CompositeMSAAOverlay()` when available
  - Legacy fallback preserved for standalone gg without gogpu
  - Tests updated for new compositor signal path

### Changed

- **deps:** gpucontext → v0.27.0 (SurfaceCompositor interface)

## [0.51.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Damage source registration API** (ADR-065) — ggcanvas migrated from
  `DamageRectSetter` to `gpucontext.DamageReporter`. Each renderer registers
  as a named damage source (`RegisterDamageSource`), gogpu unions all sources
  at present time. Chromium `cc` compositor pattern — one path for all sources.

- **Damage debug overlay** (ADR-066) — `GOGPU_DEBUG_DAMAGE=overlay` renders
  per-source colored flash-and-fade overlays with text labels via gg.Context.
  Pluggable via `gpucontext.DamageOverlayRenderer` — gogpu provides built-in
  minimal overlay, gg registers richer version with anti-aliased borders and
  text. Per-source colors (Chromium `debug_colors.cc` pattern).

### Fixed

- **TT bytecode advance cache** ([#490](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/490)) —
  `advanceResolver` ran the full TT bytecode interpreter per glyph in
  `Advance()` and `Glyphs()`, causing 60fps→15fps regression (v0.50.13).
  Added per-(ppem, glyphID) advance width cache in `ttHintCacheEntry`.
  First frame: ~40 interpreter executions (cache warm-up). Subsequent
  frames: 0 interpreter executions for advance queries.

### Changed

- Updated `gogpu/gpucontext` v0.24.0 → v0.26.0, `gogpu/wgpu` v0.30.37 → v0.31.0,
  `gogpu/gogpu` v0.50.2 → v0.51.0.
- Examples migrated from deprecated `LoadFontFace` to `text.NewFontSourceFromFile` API.
- `GOGPU_DEBUG_DAMAGE=1` renamed to `GOGPU_DEBUG_DAMAGE=overlay` (pre-v1.0 clean cut).

## [0.50.16] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **Variable font rendering advance mismatch** ([#405](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/405)) —
  `drawGlyphsVariable` used TT-hinted phantom advances (integer-rounded) for glyph
  positioning, while `Face.Advance()` / `MeasureString()` used HVAR advances (fractional).
  Rendering now uses HVAR advances via `varOrRawAdvance()`, matching FreeType
  `ttgload.c:964-977`: when HVAR present, discard TT-hinted phantom advances.
  Also fixed `faceGlyphAdvance()` (used by MultiFace/FilteredFace) to use
  `advanceResolver` for consistent advances across all text paths.

- **Shear/rotation text garbling in aliased mode** ([#405](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/405)) —
  `drawStringCPUAliased` and `drawStringCPU` routed sheared text through
  `drawStringAsOutlines` with `NoAAFiller`, which produces garbled output on
  non-axis-aligned paths. Now forces anti-aliased coverage for non-axis-aligned
  outlines, matching Skia's `computeAxisAlignmentForHText` pattern where binary
  coverage is used only for axis-aligned text.

## [0.50.15] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **Variable font advance priority — HVAR before TT hints** ([#405](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/405)) —
  v0.50.14 regression: `advanceResolver` prioritized TT-hinted advances over HVAR for
  variable fonts. TT hint cache uses default-weight phantom points (no gvar deltas),
  producing wrong advances at non-default instances (e.g. wght=700 → letters overlap
  under shear). Fixed priority matches FreeType `ttgload.c:964-977`: variable fonts
  use HVAR, static fonts use TT hinted.

- **MultiFace nil panic in GPU text paths** ([#485](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/485)) —
  `MultiFace.Source()` returns nil → panic in 4 GPU text locations (GlyphMask ×3,
  MSDF ×1). Added nil guards with graceful CPU fallback. Full per-font-run GPU
  support planned in ADR-065.

## [0.50.14] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- Updated `gogpu/wgpu` v0.30.36 → v0.30.37, `gogpu/gogpu` v0.50.0 → v0.50.2.
- Removed deprecated `Context.LoadFontFace()`. Use `text.NewFontSourceFromFile()`
  + `dc.SetFont(source.Face(size))` instead.

## [0.50.13] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **MeasureString/DrawString advance mismatch** ([#479](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/479)) —
  `Face.Advance()` returned raw unhinted advances while `drawGlyphs` used TT-hinted
  advances, causing cursor drift on wide Cyrillic glyphs (ш, щ, ж). Introduced
  `advanceResolver` as single source of truth: `Advance()`, `Glyphs()`, and
  `AppendGlyphs()` now all use the same advance (hinted when TT bytecode active,
  HVAR when variable, raw otherwise). Matches Skia/Chrome enterprise pattern.

## [0.50.12] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **MSDF `GetBatch` lock contention** ([#431](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/431)) —
  `AtlasManager.GetBatch` held write lock during entire MSDF generation phase
  (440ms for 95 glyphs). Now matches `Get()`'s lock discipline: generate MSDFs
  outside any lock, acquire write lock only for fast atlas insertion. ~7× faster
  for cache-miss workloads.

- **Variable font shear test AA sensitivity** — `TestADR054_ShearVariableFont_BoldVsRegular`
  failed locally with GPU CoverageFiller (SparseStrips) at 40px because AA fringe
  dominated pixel count. Increased to 80px where glyph body dominates.

### Changed

- Updated `gogpu/wgpu` v0.30.34 → v0.30.36 (Vulkan multi-submit present semaphore
  fix, ADR-058).
- Updated `gogpu/gogpu` v0.48.4 → v0.50.0 (outgoing drag-and-drop, Win32 OLE).
- Removed `scripts/` directory (pre-release-check.sh replaced by standard
  `go test` + `golangci-lint`).

## [0.50.11] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- **SVG vector icon rendering** ([#463](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/463),
  [#464](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/464)) — `RenderToScene` produces
  resolution-independent vector icons via the scene graph. Stroke hinting snaps
  thin strokes to the pixel grid for crisp icon rendering at any size. Scene
  renderer with stroke support. Golden tests for folder icon stroke quality.

- **Skia `cubicStroke` direct offset algorithm** — ported Skia's two-phase recursive
  cubic offset algorithm (+1077 LOC). Produces higher-quality stroked curves by
  working directly on cubic control points rather than flattening to polylines.

- **Hairline rasterizer for thin strokes** (Skia/tiny-skia pattern) —
  `treatAsHairline()` for device-pixel width ≤ 1.0, `strokeHairlineSDF` for
  circle/ellipse shape detection, 0.5px SDF calibration. TDD test suite.

- **Skia AAA forward-diff pipeline** (ADR-063) — ported `updateQuadratic`,
  `updateCubic`, `updateLine` from Skia for native curve edge stepping in the
  analytic filler. Includes SnapY snapped coordinates, monotonic pin, and
  `keepContinuous` coefficient continuity. FDot6-delta zero-height check
  (64x finer than integer comparison).

- **Deviation-based curve subdivision** (ADR-063) — De Casteljau split when
  control point deviation exceeds 0.1px. Eliminates 3px chord shift on
  stroked circles (R=120) on CPU without MSAA. Large curves get geometric
  quality; small curves remain unaffected.

- **Forward-diff curve edges as default** (ADR-063) — `SetFlattenCurves(false)`
  is now the default for SoftwareRenderer, render.SoftwareRenderer, and
  ImageSurface. Forward-diff with deviation subdivision produces visually
  smooth curves at all sizes with 30% faster performance on small paths.

- **Enterprise golden test suite** — 6 multi-contour golden tests (diff==0 with
  per-pixel Skia cross-reference), circle render comparison (fill + stroke),
  cubic waviness diagnostics (6 tests), deviation subdivision test.

- **SVG retained scene lowering** ([#466](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/466),
  @besmpl) — `Document.RenderToScene` converts SVG paths into resolution-independent
  `scene.Fill`/`scene.Stroke` commands. Shared geometry/transform/style core between
  immediate and retained renderers. Boundary tests for transforms and renderer.

- **CFF1 outline support** ([#469](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/469),
  @besmpl) — bounded Type 2 charstring interpreter with CFF INDEX/DICT parsers.
  Subroutine depth limit (10), operand stack limit (48), pathological input
  hardening. 650+ lines of tests with boundary coverage.

- **SVG thin stroke hinting** ([#467](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/467),
  [#463](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/463), @besmpl) — conservative
  pixel-grid snapping for thin horizontal/vertical strokes at small sizes (≤32px).
  Independent stroke-path copy (fill geometry never mutated). Covers both
  immediate `gg.Context` and retained `RenderToScene` paths. Eligibility:
  uniform axis scale, stroke width ≤1.5 physical px.

### Fixed

- **Portable GPU glyph-mask compositing** ([#468](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/468),
  @besmpl, ADR-060) — LCD subpixel requests downgraded to grayscale masks for
  portable rendering across all backends. Fixes premultiplied alpha compositing
  in grayscale shader path. `SetLCDLayout`/`LCDLayout` retained as preference
  for future exact backends. Strategy routing tests.

- **GPU text grayscale default** (BUG-TEXT-001) — glyph mask rendering now
  defaults to grayscale (ADR-060) instead of LCD subpixel. Fixes double alpha
  application in mask compositing. MSDF-to-mask threshold raised from 48px to
  64px for sharper small text. Updated `glyph_mask.wgsl` shader for grayscale path.

- **Bilinear image sampling in scene renderer** (BUG-ICON-001) — `blitImageToTile`
  upgraded from nearest-neighbor to bilinear interpolation. Eliminates pixelated
  edges on scaled/rotated images in the retained-mode scene graph. Also fixes
  double premultiplication in image compositing.

- **Mask gamma correction for light-on-dark text** — ported Skia `SkMaskGamma`
  for consistent text rendering on dark backgrounds. Go mirror of shader gamma
  LUT with 20 subtests.

- **Miter join sign error** — signed cross product now correctly determines miter
  join direction. Fixes incorrectly oriented miter vertices on complex path
  geometries.

- **`sharpAngle` detection** — uses `largerLen`, `f32` math, and `dot >= 0` for
  perpendicular detection. Ported `currIsLine`/`prevIsLine` from tiny-skia.
  Added `setLastPoint` for join vertex reduction (Skia pattern).

- **Value-type QuadraticEdge/CubicEdge** — curve edges are now value types instead
  of heap-allocated pointers. Eliminates per-edge heap allocations (7.6x fewer
  allocs in production steady-state, +1 alloc vs flatten mode).

### Performance

- **Forward-diff curve edges** — 30% faster on small paths compared to geometric
  flatten. Native forward differencing with O(1) per-step cost avoids
  flatten-to-polyline overhead. Deviation subdivision applied only to large curves
  where control point deviation exceeds 0.1px.

### Changed

- Updated `gogpu/gogpu` v0.48.0 → v0.48.4, `gogpu/naga` v0.17.16 → v0.18.0,
  `gogpu/wgpu` v0.30.32 → v0.30.34, `gogpu/gpucontext` v0.24.0.

## [0.50.10] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **Bind group use-after-free with shared command encoder** ([wgpu#287](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/issues/287)) —
  `RenderFrameGrouped()` released bind groups via `defer` before gogpu submitted
  the shared encoder, causing HAL descriptor corruption. Fix: defer release to
  `BeginFrame()` for shared-encoder frames where VSync guarantees GPU completion.
  Own-encoder path unchanged. Matches Skia Graphite frame-scoped resource lifecycle.

### Changed

- Updated `gogpu/wgpu` v0.30.27 → v0.30.29 (ADR-056 unified resource lifecycle,
  `Release()` via `ResourceRef.Drop()`, atomic `LastSubmissionIndex`).
- Updated example dependencies to gg v0.50.9, gogpu v0.47.1, gpucontext v0.23.0,
  wgpu v0.30.29. Removed stale `replace` directives from cjk_text and multi_damage_demo.

## [0.50.9] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **External content preservation with MSAA** ([#455](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/455),
  [#457](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/457) by [@besmpl](https://github.com/besmpl)) —
  when gg renders an overlay on top of external 3D content (e.g. g3d scene),
  MSAA vector/mixed frames now use a transparent resolve + alpha-composite path
  that preserves the underlying content without duplicating pipeline variants or
  reducing antialiasing quality. Ordinary frames have zero overhead.
- **External content overwritten by compositor base** ([#452](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/452),
  [#453](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/453)) — `DrawGPUTextureBase` no longer covers
  preserved g3d output with an opaque textured quad when `PreserveContent` is active.
- **`FlushGPUWithView` ignored external content** ([#449](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/449),
  [#450](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/450)) — added `PreserveContent` flag to
  `GPURenderTarget`; render session uses `LoadOp::Load` instead of `Clear` when set.
- **ggcanvas did not forward content preservation** ([#451](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/451)) —
  `Canvas.Render` now detects `ContentPreserver` capability and forwards the state
  to the GPU render target.
- **ggcanvas did not use shared command encoder** ([#454](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/454)) —
  `Canvas.Render` now detects `CommandEncoderProvider` on the render target and records
  into the borrowed frame encoder for single-submit compositing with gogpu.

### Changed

- Updated `gogpu/gpucontext` v0.22.0 → v0.23.0 (InputEvent sealed interface).
- Updated `gogpu/wgpu` v0.30.25 → v0.30.27 (GLES depth/stencil fix, MSAA external content preservation).

## [0.50.8] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- **`SetBlendMode()` was a no-op** ([#439](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/439)) —
  all 29 W3C blend modes are now wired through the CPU rendering pipeline.
  `SetBlendMode(BlendMultiply)` followed by `Fill()` or `Stroke()` now
  correctly uses the specified blend mode instead of silently defaulting
  to SourceOver. Default path (SourceOver) has zero overhead — same inlined
  fast path as before.

### Added

- **All 29 W3C blend modes for direct Fill/Stroke** — 14 Porter-Duff
  compositing operators, 11 advanced separable modes (Multiply, Screen,
  Overlay, Darken, Lighten, ColorDodge, ColorBurn, HardLight, SoftLight,
  Difference, Exclusion), 4 non-separable HSL modes (Hue, Saturation,
  Color, Luminosity). Matches Skia/Cairo/Qt per-operation blending model.
- `BlendClear`, `BlendSource`, `BlendDestination` — previously missing
  Porter-Duff constants now exported.
- `GetBlendMode()` — returns the current blend mode.
- `BlendDestination` strength reduction — draws with Destination blend mode
  are fast-rejected (no-op), matching Skia/tiny-skia pattern.
- 115 enterprise blend mode tests with pixel-level verification for all
  29 modes, gradient fills, anti-aliased geometry, semi-transparent
  foreground, stroke blending, and byte-level formula validation.
- **Shaper HVAR advances for variable fonts** ([#405](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/405)) —
  OwnShaper and BuiltinShaper used base-weight hmtx advances while outlines
  had gvar deltas applied (ADR-054). Bold glyphs at narrower spacing caused
  letters to overlap under shear/rotation. Fix: shapers now use
  `GlyphAdvanceVar` (HVAR-adjusted) when face has variations, matching
  the skrifa invariant.
- `ScaleAbout(sx, sy, x, y)` — scale around a point, matching `RotateAbout`
  ([#442](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/442)). Also `ShearAbout`.
- `LoadFontFace` undeprecated — convenience one-liner for quick start.
  Advanced usage (variable fonts, features) still uses `text.NewFontSourceFromFile`.
- "Common Patterns" section in README: FillPreserve+Stroke, Clear vs
  ClearWithColor, LoadFontFace, ScaleAbout.
- **Separate fill and stroke brushes** ([#438](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/438)) —
  `SetFillBrush` and `SetStrokeBrush` are now genuinely independent, matching
  HTML5 Canvas `fillStyle`/`strokeStyle` semantics. Previously they aliased to
  the same brush. `SetColor`/`SetRGB`/`SetHexColor` set both (backward compat).
  Paint internally uses a `brushState` struct for each side with explicit
  `FillColorAt`/`StrokeColorAt` methods. SoftwareRenderer and GPU pipeline
  route fill/stroke operations to the correct brush. ADR-055.
- **Push/Pop saves paint state** — `Push`/`Pop` now save and restore fill brush,
  stroke brush, and blend mode (matching Cairo `cairo_save`/Canvas `ctx.save`).
  Previously paint was not saved — pre-existing bug.

### Changed

- Updated `gogpu/wgpu` v0.30.22 → v0.30.23, `gogpu/naga` v0.17.15 → v0.17.16,
  `go-webgpu/goffi` v0.6.0 → v0.6.2, `go-webgpu/webgpu` v0.5.3 → v0.5.4.

## [0.50.7] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **Variable font outlines under transforms** ([#405](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/405)) —
  when `dc.Shear()` or `dc.Rotate()` was applied, variable font variations
  (e.g. `wght=700`) were silently ignored because the vector outline path called
  `ExtractOutline()` without gvar deltas. All 7 outline extraction paths now use
  `ExtractOutlineHintedVar()` with `face.Variations()`, matching the Skia/skrifa/
  FreeType invariant: gvar deltas are glyph geometry, applied unconditionally.
  Cache keys (`OutlineCacheKey`, `GlyphMaskKey`, `msdf.GlyphKey`) now include
  `VariationHash` to prevent cross-variation cache poisoning.

### Added

- `GlyphMaskRasterizer.RasterizeHintedVar()` — rasterize glyph masks with
  font variations applied (gvar + hinting in one pass).
- `GlyphMaskRasterizer.RasterizeAliasedVar()` — aliased (binary coverage)
  variant with font variations.
- `RenderParams.Variations` field — propagates font variations through
  `GlyphRenderer` for vector outline extraction.
- `GlyphMaskKey.VariationHash` — distinguishes glyph mask cache entries for
  different variable font instances.
- `msdf.GlyphKey.VariationHash` — distinguishes MSDF atlas entries for
  different variable font instances.
- 17 enterprise tests covering all fixed paths (context-level shear/rotation,
  text package cache keys, rasterizer variations, MSDF atlas keys).

### Changed

- Updated `gogpu/wgpu` v0.30.21 → v0.30.22.

## [0.50.6] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **Software backend GPU texture compositing** — five latent bugs fixed in the
  software SPIR-V render path, enabling `DrawGPUTexture` overlays (RepaintBoundary
  pattern) on CPU-only adapters. Coordinated fixes across wgpu `hal/software/`
  (3 bugs) and gg `internal/gpu/` (2 bugs):
  - wgpu: `CopyTextureToBuffer` row stride — row-by-row copy respecting
    `BytesPerRow` alignment (was flat memcpy, causing 128-byte/row shift at 800px).
  - wgpu: `configureRasterPipeline` blend state — extract premultiplied alpha
    blend from `Fragment.Targets[0].Blend` (was always `BlendDisabled`).
  - wgpu: `readTexel` BGRA format — swap R/B channels for `BGRA8Unorm` textures
    (was always reading as RGBA).
  - gg: `ensurePipelineWithStencil` for readback — create image pipeline when
    `earlyBlitOnly` skips `ensurePipelines()` on blit-only readback path.
  - gg: `uploadPixmapToView` overwrite guard — prevent `c.pixmap` background from
    overwriting offscreen texture content after `flushCPUToView` upload.

### Added

- `examples/compositing/` — boundary texture test with offscreen textures,
  DrawGPUTexture, DrawImage, text, animated shapes on all backends.
- `examples/software_overlay/` — minimal DrawGPUTexture regression test.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.30.20 → v0.30.21 (software backend fixes).
- **ARCHITECTURE.md:** new Software Backend Strategy section.
- `glyphMaskDebugLog` uses `slogger().Debug()` instead of `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr)`.

## [0.50.5] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Backend-agnostic draw queue** (ADR-051) — shapes enqueued at draw time with
  paint/path value copies and pre-tessellation, dispatched at flush time to GPU
  render pass (strategyFull) or CPU SoftwareRenderer (strategyRasterAtlas).
  Matches Skia Graphite DrawList / Flutter DisplayList pattern.

- **Three-tier clip architecture** (ADR-052) — Layer A: rect bounds for scanline/tile
  skip (zero per-pixel cost). Layer B: pre-rasterized ClipMask `[]uint8` snapshot
  at queue time for deferred dispatch. Replaces stale closure-based ClipCoverage.

- **Enterprise test suite** — 80+ new tests across 5 files: canvas.Render mock tests
  (all 3 present paths), draw queue dispatch, scissor group splitting, clip mask
  lifetime safety, stroke dispatch pixel verification (TDD, diff=0). 30 profiling
  benchmarks. Test files split by domain (dispatch, queue, coverage, profiling).

- **SurfacePixelWriter zero-copy path** — capability-based routing via error return
  (no backend type check). On software backend, writes pixmap directly to surface
  framebuffer via `PresentPixels`. Coordinated with wgpu v0.30.20 (check-before-
  mutate) and gogpu v0.44.7 (`pixelPresented` frame lifecycle flag).

- `SetRasterizerMode()` exported method on SoftwareRenderer.
- FPS counter in gogpu_integration example.

### Fixed

- **SurfacePixelWriter regression** (bb69045) — `PresentPixels` on GPU backends
  discarded acquired texture before checking backend support, causing 3 FPS on
  Vulkan. Damage rects incorrectly forwarded for full-frame pixel upload, causing
  partial blit trails on software backend. Three coordinated fixes across wgpu
  (check-before-mutate), gogpu (`pixelPresented` flag), gg (capability routing).

- **Double stroke expansion** (C-1) — `dispatchDrawsToSoftware` called `sr.Stroke()`
  on pre-expanded fill path, producing double-width geometry. Fixed to `sr.Fill()`.

- **Stroke filler regression** — SparseStripsFiller (4x4 tiles) cannot handle
  multi-contour stroke geometry (inner+outer ring with EvenOdd). Draw queue
  dispatch now forces RasterizerAnalytic for pre-expanded stroke paths, matching
  `SoftwareRenderer.Stroke()` internal behavior.

- **Software backend offscreen textures** — split `deviceReady` from `gpuReady`.
  `CreateOffscreenTexture` checks `deviceReady`. `ensurePipelines()` skips shape
  pipelines on rasterAtlas (Skia Graphite `TextureProxy::Make()` pattern).

- **Stale ClipCoverage closure** — cleared at queue time (4 enqueue sites) to
  prevent stale clip stack reference reaching dispatch without cleanup.

### Performance

- **BGRA swizzle buffer pooled** (P0) — 8.3 MB/frame → 0 allocs steady state, 20% faster.
- **SoftwareRenderer cached** (P1) — 13 allocs/flush → 0, 3300x faster (1.5ns vs 5μs).
- **scratchStrokePath reuse** (P3) — 1 alloc/stroke → 0, 7x faster (46ns vs 324ns).
- **GC retention zeroed** (P2) — `pendingDraws` pointer fields zeroed before `[:0]`
  truncation (Skia OpChain::reset pattern).
- **tmpPixmap cached** (P4) — offscreen pixmap reused across frames.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.30.20 → v0.30.21 (software backend fixes), gogpu v0.44.7.

## [0.50.4] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **Composite glyph DoS hardening** (#418) — added shared work budget
  (`maxCompositeComponents=4096`) and cycle-detection map to both composite
  recursion sites. The depth-only guard (32 levels) did not bound multiplicative
  fan-out (F siblings × N levels = F^N resolutions). Cycle hits now degrade
  gracefully; gvar delta application skipped for composites (wrong point-number
  space corrupted variable font geometry). Patch contributed by issue author.
- **Software adapter hang** (#421) — SDF GPU pipeline hung on software/CPU adapters
  (llvmpipe, SwiftShader, WARP). `SDFAccelerator` now implements `AdapterAware` —
  shapes route to CPU rasterizer on software, GPU device stays alive for textures.
  Follows Skia Graphite `kRasterAtlas` pattern. Regression from ADR-046 refactoring.

### Added

- **Tiered GPU rendering strategy** — `gpuRenderStrategy` enum (Full/NoMSAA/RasterAtlas)
  auto-detected from adapter type + MSAA support. Replaces binary softwareMode checks.
  Follows Skia Graphite `PathRendererStrategy` pattern.
- **CI GPU golden tests** — Mesa lavapipe installed on Ubuntu CI. GPU/CPU dual-render
  comparison tests (Vello `compare_gpu_cpu` pattern). Non-blocking job with annotations.
- **GPU/CPU golden test framework** — `computeImageDiff()` perceptual comparison,
  diff visualization, 6 test cases (circle, rectangle, line, stroke, triangle, overlapping).

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** golang.org/x/image v0.43.0 → v0.44.0,
  golang.org/x/text v0.39.0 → v0.40.0.

## [0.50.3] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.30.9 → v0.30.10, gogpu v0.43.4 → v0.44.1,
  golang.org/x/text v0.38.0 → v0.39.0.

## [0.50.2] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Composite glyph tests** — comprehensive portable tests for composite glyphs
  (i, j, accented characters) using bundled fonts. Verifies recursive component
  flattening, TT hinting dispatch, and outline extraction on all platforms.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.30.8 → v0.30.9 (goffi v0.5.6 callback stack-move fix),
  gogpu v0.43.3 → v0.43.4 (cascade).
- **Examples:** added `WithContinuousRender(true)` for gogpu v0.43.3 event-driven default.

## [0.50.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **TT GETINFO instruction** — ClearType selector bits were off by one vs skrifa/FreeType.
  Segoe UI prep program received wrong ClearType feature answers, causing incorrect CVT
  values and wrong Y coordinates for complex glyphs ('w' at 12ppem). Golden test: 20/20
  points match skrifa.
- **ttDiv16Dot16 rounding** — truncated → rounded division matching skrifa `Fixed::div`.
  Improves IUP interpolation precision for all TT-hinted fonts.
- **Space glyph TT hinting** — empty glyphs (space, .notdef) now produce integer-pixel
  hinted advances via phantom-only outlines. Before: space 24ppem=6.5742 (fractional,
  uneven word spacing). After: 7.0000 (integer, skrifa parity diff=0).

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.30.7 → v0.30.8 (MSAA rejection, BGRA swizzle, buffer offsets),
  gogpu v0.43.2 → v0.43.3 (WM_PAINT fix), x/image v0.43.0, x/text v0.38.0.

## [0.50.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **HVAR variable font advance parser** (ADR-050, #405) — own Pure Go HVAR table
  parser for variable font advance width deltas. No go-text dependency for advance
  computation. ItemVariationStore is reusable across HVAR, VVAR, MVAR, GDEF, COLR.
  Golden tests: 6/6 diff=0 against skrifa (VAZIRMATN_VAR).
- **TT interpreter skrifa golden tests** (#405) — 1872 coordinate pairs (624 points
  × 3 sizes) extracted from Google skrifa via instrumented `hint/instance.rs`.
  Coordinate-exact diff=0 comparison at 12, 16, 24 ppem.
- **Pure Go font table parsers** (ADR-048, #405) — own cmap (format 4/6/12), hmtx/hhea,
  name, head/OS/2 parsers. New `ownParsedFont` implementing full `ParsedFont` interface
  with zero sfnt dependency. Cross-validated against ximageParsedFont: exact parity.
  Glyph outline extraction, GlyphBounds, auto-hinter blue zones generalized for both
  parser types. 37 tests.
- **Pure Go gvar/avar parsers** (ADR-048, #405) — gvar: tuple variation data, packed
  deltas (int8/int16/zero runs), IUP interpolation (skrifa Jiggler pattern). avar:
  piecewise linear axis remapping (HarfBuzz-compatible edge cases). Skrifa golden
  parity: phantom point deltas diff=0 (`gvar.rs` test data). 21 tests.
- **Pure Go GSUB/GPOS shaper** (ADR-048, #405) — own text shaper replacing
  go-text/typesetting HarfBuzz. GSUB: single, multiple, alternate, ligature
  substitution + extension. GPOS: single adjustment, pair kerning (format 1+2) +
  extension. Legacy kern table fallback. OpenType layout engine (ScriptList,
  FeatureList, Coverage, ClassDef). 5.8-10x faster than GoTextShaper. 27 tests.

### Changed

- **Default font parser** switched from `ximageParsedFont` (x/image/font/sfnt) to
  `ownParsedFont` (Pure Go). Zero external font dependency on default code path.
- **Default text shaper** switched from `BuiltinShaper` (LTR-only) to `OwnShaper`
  (GSUB/GPOS with ligatures and kerning). 5.8-10x faster than go-text HarfBuzz.
- **glyf parser** rewritten: own binary parser replaces go-text `tables.ParseGlyf`.
- **fvar/name parsers** in source.go: own binary parsing replaces go-text loaders.
- Legacy paths (ximageParsedFont, GoTextShaper) kept as opt-in for backward compat.

### Fixed

- **TT interpreter fixed-point math** (#405) — 3 rounding bugs found via skrifa golden
  comparison: `ttMul16Dot16` sign correction for negative products (skrifa `Fixed::mul`),
  scale computation rounded division (skrifa `Fixed::div`), phantom points from OS/2
  `sTypoAscender`/`sTypoDescender` (skrifa `setup_phantom_points`).
- **TT interpreter twilight zone** (#405) — 5 instruction bugs causing 561/624 Y
  coordinate mismatches: MIAP/MIRP/MSIRP missing original-point updates for twilight
  zone reference points, SCFS missing current→original copy, `movePoint` CoordBoth
  wrong multiply chain (fixed to `ttMulDiv(distance, fv, fdotp)` matching skrifa
  `zone.rs`). Result: 624/624 diff=0 at all sizes.

## [0.49.6] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Enterprise auto-hinter: skrifa golden test parity** (#405) — 17/19 golden tests
  pass with diff=0 against Google skrifa (fontations). Complete auto-hinter pipeline
  ported from skrifa: segments, edges, hinting, point alignment.
  - **Script-aware detection** — Hebrew, CJK, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic character lists
    for blue zones and standard widths (6 scripts supported).
  - **Hebrew LONG blue zones** — skrifa long segment detection algorithm for vertical
    serif avoidance in Hebrew letterforms.
  - **CJK full pipeline** — segment linking, edge detection, edge hinting, stem width
    quantization. 114/114 coordinates diff=0 on NotoSerifTC.
  - **Hinted advance widths** (ADR-049) — auto-hinter edge-based advance adjustment
    matching skrifa `instance.rs`. Fixes uneven letter spacing at 12-16px.
  - **4 test fonts** from skrifa: Ahem (Skia regression), NotoSerifTC (CJK),
    autohint_cmap (script classification), cubic_glyf (edge cases).

### Fixed

- **Letter spacing** (#405) — auto-hinter EdgeMetrics advance adjustment (skrifa
  `instance.rs` parity). Computes adjusted advance from hinted edge positions,
  eliminating spacing drift. Layout→rendering advance consistency planned for
  TASK-FONT-005 (TrueType interpreter with phantom points).
- **adjustSegmentHeights** — integer right-shift `>>1` matching skrifa (was float `/2`).
- **isCornerFlat** — skrifa JIT triangle inequality formula (was cross/dot parallelism).
- **CJK alignEdgePoints** — delta mode for CJK (was snap mode for all scripts).
- **Fixed-point arithmetic** — sign-aware `fixedMul26dot6`/`fixedDiv26dot6` matching
  skrifa `Fixed::Mul`/`Fixed::Div`.
- **Scale computation** — truncation matching skrifa integer division (was `math.Round`).
- **Blue zone direction matching** — V-dimension uses `dirLeft` (was hardcoded `dirUp`).
- **wrap.go** goconst lint fix (`"None"` → `noneStr`).

## [0.49.5] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **Aliased variable font hinting** (#385, #405) — apply `gridFitOutline` to go-text
  extracted outlines for aliased mode only. AA uses unhinted outlines (Skia pattern:
  `FT_LOAD_TARGET_MONO` for kAlias, lighter hinting for kAntiAlias). Enterprise
  auto-hinter upgrade (FreeType parity) tracked in #405.

## [0.49.4] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **Aliased text with variable fonts** (#385) — `TextModeAliased` / `DrawAliased` ignored
  variable font variations, rendering with 256-level AA instead of binary (0/255) coverage.
  Root cause: `drawGlyphsVariable` hardcoded AA rasterization, discarding the aliased callback.
  Fix: outline extraction and rasterization mode are now orthogonal (Skia `SkFont::Edging` pattern).
  New `RasterizeOutlineAliased` public method, `glyphRasterMode` enum, mode propagated through
  variable font rendering path. 2 tests: binary-only coverage validation, AA vs aliased ink comparison.

## [0.49.3] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- **Examples:** gogpu v0.42.11 → v0.43.0 (event-driven rendering by default).
  Removed explicit `WithContinuousRender(false)` from all examples — now the default.

## [0.49.2] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **Variable font rendering** (#385) — variations (weight, width, etc.) were stored and
  shaped correctly but not applied during glyph rasterization. The rendering pipeline
  used `golang.org/x/image/font/sfnt` which lacks gvar/HVAR support, so all weights
  rendered with default outlines. Fix: when a face has variations, extract outlines via
  go-text/typesetting (`font.Face.GlyphData`) which interpolates gvar deltas and applies
  HVAR advance adjustments. Both `drawGlyphs` (CPU bitmap) and `drawShapedGlyphsAsOutlines`
  (CPU vector fallback) now route through go-text for variable fonts. 3 rendering
  tests added: ink-pixel comparison (bold/light ratio), outline extraction validation,
  and non-variable regression check.

- **GPU features on software adapters** (BUG-GPU-003, ADR-046) — `SetDeviceProvider`
  blanket-disabled GPU when `DeviceType == CPU`, nullifying device/queue/instance. This
  prevented offscreen texture creation on llvmpipe (`blitCount=0` → boundary textures
  never composited → ListView items invisible). Enterprise research (Skia Graphite,
  wgpu, Vello, Flutter Impeller) unanimously confirms software adapters should be treated
  as full GPU implementations. Fix: `softwareMode` is now informational only — device
  kept, GPU features available. Capability differences handled via MSAA probing. Verified
  on llvmpipe: `blitCount=10`, all items at correct positions.

- **CreateOffscreenTexture error logging** — all error paths in `CreateOffscreenTexture`
  (gpu_render_context.go) now log via slog with context (error, dimensions, format, usage).
  Previously 3 error paths silently returned nil TextureView with no diagnostics.

## [0.49.1] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **MSAA runtime fallback** (BUG-GPU-001, Skia Graphite pattern) — replace hardcoded
  `sampleCount=4` with runtime probe via `resolveSampleCount()`. Try 4x MSAA, fall back
  to 1x on software backends (llvmpipe, SwiftShader). Threaded through 14 production
  files (~30 usage sites).

- **Offscreen render pass direct rendering** (BUG-GPU-002) — when `sampleCount=1`,
  render directly to target view without MSAA indirection. Fixes WebGPU spec violation:
  `ResolveTarget` with `sampleCount=1` causes Vulkan HAL to skip resolve, leaving
  offscreen boundary textures empty. Text in child boundaries now visible on llvmpipe.

- **Glyph mask bind group lifecycle** — defer bind group creation to after pipeline
  stabilization (`materializeGlyphMaskBindGroups`). On first frame, `ensureClipBindLayout`
  triggers `destroyPipeline` which releases `uniformLayout`; bind groups created before
  this point referenced the destroyed layout (undefined behavior, strict on llvmpipe).

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** gputypes v0.5.0 → v0.5.1, wgpu v0.30.5 → v0.30.7 (FEAT-GPUTYPES-001 cascade).
- **Examples:** gogpu v0.42.7 → v0.42.10.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **Variable font support** (#385, ADR-044) — expose go-text/typesetting's OpenType
  variable font capabilities through gg's text API. Single font file, multiple styles:
  - `FontVariation` type + `NewFontVariation(tag, value)` constructor
  - `WithVariations()` `FaceOption` — set axis values at face creation time
  - `Face.Variations()` accessor
  - `FontSource.IsVariable()` — check if font has variation axes
  - `FontSource.VariationAxes()` — query axes with min/default/max ranges
  - `FontSource.NamedInstances()` — discover predefined instances ("Bold", "Light")
  - 5 axis constants: `AxisWeight`, `AxisWidth`, `AxisItalic`, `AxisSlant`, `AxisOpticalSize`
  - Glyph cache key includes variation hash — different axes produce distinct cache entries
  - 32 tests covering types, options, font queries, cache keys, shaper integration, and end-to-end verification
  - Example: `examples/variable_font/`

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.30.4 → v0.30.5 (software backend text rendering fix, @samyfodil).
- **Examples:** gogpu v0.42.7 → v0.42.9 (Wayland frame callback gating).

## [0.48.17] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **macOS Metal stencil rendering** (#390, @samyfodil) — adopt wgpu v0.30.4 which
  fixes Metal HAL not translating stencil state into `MTLDepthStencilState`. Stencil
  test was silently inert (`compare=Always`), causing stencil-then-cover fills to
  flood the entire cover quad: rounded panels rendered as squares, clipped content
  vanished. 3 Metal regression tests added (circle, rounded rect, even-odd ring).

### Changed

- **Architecture: remove HAL imports from production code** — gg no longer imports
  `wgpu/hal/vulkan` directly. Backend registration belongs in the application
  (gogpu registers all backends per-platform via `gpu/backend/native/`). gg is a
  pure consumer of the wgpu WebGPU standard API. Metal test rewritten to use
  `wgpu.CreateInstance(BackendsMetal)` public API instead of `hal/metal` import.

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.30.3 → v0.30.4.

## [0.48.16] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **GPU-direct stroke rendering regression** — v0.48.15 routed ALL strokes and
  EvenOdd fills through Vello compute in `PipelineModeAuto`. Vello's `compositeOver()`
  writes to `target.Data` (CPU pixmap), ignoring `target.View` (GPU texture). This
  made strokes invisible when using `FlushGPUWithView()` — the primary rendering
  path for ui RepaintBoundary textures. Affected: spinner arcs, chart lines,
  dropdown borders/chevrons, any stroke through SceneCanvas replay.
  Fix: revert routing to explicit `PipelineModeCompute` only. Stencil-then-cover
  (with v0.48.15 IncrementWrap+WriteMask=0x01 hardening) handles `target.View`
  correctly via render session `resolveActiveView()`. Proper GPU-direct Vello
  output (storage texture + blit, Rust Vello pattern) tracked for v0.49.0.

## [0.48.15] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **AMD Vulkan: strokes render as solid fills** (#374, @TimLai666, @lkmavi) — route
  expanded strokes and EvenOdd fills through Vello compute pipeline, bypassing stencil
  entirely. AMD NAVI Vulkan drivers execute stencil per-fragment instead of per-sample
  under MSAA (RPCS3 #6999), breaking even-odd parity counting. Compute pipeline renders
  correctly on all backends. Stencil-then-cover remains as fallback when compute is
  unavailable (Software/GLES backends, explicit `PipelineModeRenderPass`).

- **Stencil EvenOdd hardening** (#378, @lkmavi) — replace `StencilOperationInvert` with
  `IncrementWrap + WriteMask=0x01` (Skia Graphite kToggle parity pattern). Restricts
  stencil writes to bit 0 only — mathematically equivalent but avoids full 8-bit Invert.
  Applied to both base and depth-clipped EvenOdd pipelines. Strokes now unconditionally
  use EvenOdd fill rule (HadInnerJoin conditional removed).

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.30.2 → v0.30.3.

## [0.48.14] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.30.1 → v0.30.2, gogpu v0.42.1 → v0.42.5 in examples.

## [0.48.13] - 2026-06-20

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** gogpu v0.42.0 → v0.42.1 in examples.

## [0.48.12] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **AMD stencil invert driver bug workaround** (#374, @lkmavi) — `StencilOperationInvert`
  fails on AMD Radeon 890M D3D12, causing thin round-rect strokes to render as solid fills.
  Fix: select fill rule dynamically based on path topology via `HadInnerJoin()`. Smooth paths
  (round-rects, circles with cubic arcs) use NonZero (opposite winding cancels without Invert).
  Sharp-cornered paths (rectangles, polygons) keep EvenOdd for correct V-shape handling.
  Applied to both `GPURenderContext.StrokePath` and `VelloAccelerator.StrokePath`.
  3 regression tests added in `expander_test.go`.

## [0.48.11] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **Thin strokes render as solid fills on GPU compute path** (#369, ADR-043, @TimLai666) —
  `VelloAccelerator.StrokePath` passed the original paint (NonZero fill rule) to `FillPath`
  after stroke expansion. The expanded outline has two contours (outer + inner, opposite
  winding) — NonZero fills both as solid, EvenOdd correctly cancels the inner to produce a
  hollow ring. `GPURenderContext.StrokePath` already set EvenOdd; this makes the compute
  path consistent. Affects all 1px+ strokes via Vello compute pipeline (default for
  medium-complexity scenes). 2 regression tests added.

## [0.48.10] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **Backdrop prefix sum boundary leak** (BUG-BACKDROP-001, ADR-042) — `CalculateBackdrop`
  propagated winding across ALL tile columns in each row. When rotated text glyphs had
  unclosed contours in the coarse grid, winding leaked to the right edge → solid black
  pixel artifacts 93px past text boundary. Fix: bound prefix sum to per-row entry extents,
  matching Vello `backdrop_dyn.wgsl` pattern. Regression since v0.48.6 (PR #357).

### Changed

- **wgpu v0.30.1 opaque handle migration** — `gpucontext.Device`/`Queue`/`Adapter` changed
  from interfaces to opaque structs. Type assertions replaced with `wgpu.DeviceFromHandle()`
  and `wgpu.AdapterFromHandle()` helpers. Zero `unsafe.Pointer` usage in gg.
- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.29.15 → v0.30.1, gogpu v0.41.14 → v0.42.0, gpucontext v0.19.0 → v0.21.0.

## [0.48.9] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **Glyph mask quadOffset not advanced on nil bind group** (BUG-GLYPHMASK-001, #365) —
  `buildGlyphMaskDrawCalls` skipped batches with nil bind groups via `continue` without
  advancing `quadOffset`. All subsequent batches received wrong `indexOffset` into the
  shared vertex/index buffer, causing text to be invisible or garbled in offscreen GPU
  textures (e.g., RepaintBoundary in ui). Affects all backends, not GLES-specific.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.29.14 → v0.29.15, naga v0.17.14 → v0.17.15,
  gogpu v0.41.4 → v0.41.14 in examples.

## [0.48.8] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- **HiDPI double-scale in text outlines** (#361, @TuSKan) — `drawStringAsOutlines` and
  `StrokeString` applied `deviceMatrix` twice: once in `path.Transform(totalMatrix())`, then
  again in `doFill()/doStroke()` via `deviceSpacePath()`. At 2x scale, text position was
  doubled and scale was squared. Fix: use `c.matrix` (user matrix only), matching
  Cairo/Skia deviceMatrix/userMatrix separation pattern (v0.37.4).

### Added

- **OpenType font features** (#362, @TuSKan) — `WithFeatures(text.TabularNums)` for tabular
  figures, ligature control, kerning, small caps. `NewFontFeature("tnum", 1)` string
  constructor. 7 predefined constants. Features applied during HarfBuzz shaping via
  `GoTextShaper`. Fixed hardcoded `language.NewLanguage("en")` → `face.Language()`.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.29.1 → v0.29.4, gogpu v0.41.0 → v0.41.4 in examples.

## [0.48.7] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.28.7 → v0.29.1, gogpu v0.39.1 → v0.40.0 in examples.

## [0.48.6] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **SparseStripsFiller winding propagation** (BUG-SPARSE-STRIPS-001) — interior tiles
  between shape edges rendered as empty gaps. Fixed backdrop calculation to use Vello
  `backdrop.wgsl` prefix-sum pattern, added `windingDelta` propagation between non-adjacent
  tiles (Rust Vello `strip.rs:259-263`), and backdrop-only tile emission for filled interiors.

- **SDF thin stroke invisible on GPU** (#346, ADR-040) — SDF stroke with `lineWidth < 2.0`
  now falls back to geometric expansion. The SDF annular ring at sub-2px widths is thinner
  than the smoothstep AA zone, producing near-zero coverage. Affects both CPU SDF accelerator
  and GPU render context. M3 Outlined button (lineWidth=1.5) now renders correctly.

- **Present damage union** (TASK-GG-PRESENT-DAMAGE-UNION) — `forwardDamageRects` now unions
  explicit rects from `SetPresentDamage()` with immediate-mode `FrameDamage`, never letting
  caller understate actual damage. Previously explicit rects overrode frame damage, causing
  DWM flickering when debug overlay drew outside declared damage region.

## [0.48.5] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **Fractional glyph advances: letters merging at 10-12px** (ADR-039) — `GlyphAdvance()`
  now uses `font.HintingNone` for layout advances (design metrics, fractional) instead of
  `font.HintingFull` (grid-fitted, integer-rounded). At 12px Arial, "T" advance changes
  from 7.0 to 7.33, preserving the 0.97px gap between "T" and "e" that was lost to rounding.
  Matches Skia `linearHoriAdvance` / Cairo `hint_metrics=OFF` enterprise pattern.

- **TextModeAliased CPU fallback** (#353) — `dc.SetTextMode(gg.TextModeAliased)` now works
  on CPU-only contexts (`gg.NewContext()` + `SavePNG()`). Uses per-glyph `NoAAFiller`
  rasterization (binary 0/255 coverage), matching Skia `SkFont::Edging::kAlias` and
  GPU Tier 6 path. Previously fell back to `x/image/font.Drawer` which always anti-aliases.

- **SDF thin stroke invisible on GPU** (#346, ADR-040) — SDF stroke with `lineWidth < 2.0`
  now falls back to geometric expansion. The SDF annular ring at sub-2px widths is thinner
  than the smoothstep AA zone, producing near-zero coverage. Affects both CPU SDF accelerator
  and GPU render context. M3 Outlined button (lineWidth=1.5) now renders correctly.

### Changed

- **Per-glyph text rendering** — `text.Draw()` replaced `font.Drawer` with per-glyph
  rendering via `GlyphMaskRasterizer.RasterizeHinted()`. Enables independent control of
  outline hinting (crisp stems) and advance positioning (fractional). Shared `drawGlyphs()`
  helper used by both `Draw()` and `DrawAliased()`.

### Added

- `text.DrawAliased()` — CPU aliased text rendering function, parallel to `text.Draw()`.
- 13 new tests: `TestDrawAliased_BinaryAlpha`, `TestDrawAliased_MultipleSizes`,
  `TestTextModeAliased_BinaryAlpha`, `TestTextModeAliased_DrawString_CPUFallback`,
  and 9 more covering edge cases and GPU/CPU consistency.

## [0.48.4] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **Stroke inner join: teeth on circles, twisted corners on rectangles** (#354, #353) —
  `handleInnerJoin` now emits two `lineTo` calls matching tiny-skia `stroker.rs:1370-1379`:
  first routes through pivot to prevent self-intersection, then places the inner path at
  the correct normal offset for the next segment (ADR-038). Previously the second `lineTo`
  was missing, causing the inner path to "jump" diagonally from pivot to the next segment,
  creating visible sawtooth artifacts on thick strokes (lineWidth ≥ 5). Affects all curved
  shapes: circles, ellipses, rounded rectangles, arcs, regular polygons, glyph outlines.

### Changed

- **StrokeString godoc** — added recommendation to use `SetLineJoin(LineJoinRound)` for
  thick text strokes. Default `LineJoinMiter` produces miter spikes at glyph segment
  junctions, matching enterprise text renderer behavior (Skia, Cairo, Qt).

### Added

- Tests: `TestStrokeExpander_ThickCircleNoTeeth` (4 lineWidth values), 
  `TestStrokeExpander_ThickRectNoRotation` (4 lineWidth values),
  `TestStrokeExpander_InnerJoinOffset` — regression tests for #354.

## [0.48.3] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **SDF pipeline: transparent fill makes stroke invisible** (BUG-SDF-001) — `QueueShape`
  now skips zero-alpha shapes. Premultiplied SrcOver blend with (0,0,0,0) is a mathematical
  no-op but interfered with MSAA sample coverage weighting, causing subsequent strokes on
  the same shape to render invisibly. Matches Skia `SkPaint::nothingToDraw()` (alpha==0 +
  SrcOver → skip) and Cairo `nothing_to_do()` patterns.

## [0.48.2] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Stroke expander: match Rust kurbo output** (#347) — root cause fix for stroke
  rendering. Inner join handler emitted extra `lineTo(pivot+afterNorm)` and skip-threshold
  path emitted connecting segments that Rust kurbo does not. Result: 397 elements (Go) vs
  201 (Rust kurbo) with 196 duplicate points creating self-intersecting outlines. Fixed to
  produce identical 201-element output matching Rust kurbo golden reference.

- **Stroke fills routed through AnalyticFiller** — architectural routing matching Skia Ganesh
  pattern (strokes → scanline renderer, not tile rasterizer). Multi-contour closed-path
  strokes (e.g., glyph "O" → 4 contours) require per-scanline winding tracking.

### Added

- Golden test `TestStrokeExpander_SineWaveGolden` — verifies 201 elements, 0 duplicate
  points, 0 self-intersections, key coordinates match Rust kurbo.

## [0.48.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **GPU stroke renders polyline as filled polygon** (#347, @TuSKan) — three-part fix
  for GPU-accelerated stroke rendering of multi-segment polylines (ADR-037):

  1. **CPU stroke filler selection** — stroke-expanded fills now force AnalyticFiller
     (scanline AA), bypassing SparseStripsFiller which has a winding propagation bug
     for self-intersecting stroke outlines (BUG-SPARSE-STRIPS-001). This is the primary
     fix for pixmap contexts where GPU fallback to CPU produces thick aliased strokes.

  2. **GPU lazy initialization** — `FillPath`/`StrokePath` now call `ensureGPU()` for
     lazy device creation, matching the pattern used by text methods (`DrawText`).
     Previously GPU path always failed for pixmap contexts (`gpuReady=false`).

  3. **Convex fast-path FillRule gate** — convex polygon renderer now skipped for
     `FillRuleEvenOdd` paths. Stroke-expanded outlines can pass `IsConvex()` check
     despite self-intersecting; convex renderer ignores FillRule, filling the convex
     hull. Added Skia-style direction-flip check (`IsConcaveBySign` pattern) to
     `IsConvex()` for additional protection.

### Changed

- `IsConvex()` now checks direction-flip count per axis (max 3, matching Skia
  `IsConcaveBySign` and femtovg). Rejects self-intersecting stroke outlines that
  previously passed the cross-product-sign-only check.

### Dependencies

- gogpu v0.39.0, wgpu v0.28.7, gpucontext v0.19.0

## [0.48.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Text stroke/outline API** (ADR-033, #334, @rcarlier) — enterprise text stroke matching
  Skia `kStroke_Style`, Cairo `cairo_text_path`, HTML5 `strokeText`, Vello `DrawGlyphs+Stroke`:
  - `StrokeString(s, x, y)` — strokes glyph outlines using current line width/cap/join
  - `StrokeStringAnchored(s, x, y, ax, ay)` — anchored variant
  - `TextPath(s, x, y) *Path` — returns glyph outlines as Path for fill/stroke/clip
  - Always uses vector outlines regardless of TextMode (MSDF/GlyphMask can't be stroked)
  - Recording mirror: `StrokeTextCommand`

  ```go
  dc.SetLineWidth(3)
  dc.SetRGB(0, 0, 0)
  dc.StrokeString("Hello", x, y)  // black outline
  dc.SetRGB(1, 1, 1)
  dc.DrawString("Hello", x, y)    // white fill on top
  ```

- **Aliased text mode** (ADR-034, #334, @rcarlier) — pixel-perfect text rendering with binary
  coverage (0 or 255, no gray pixels). Matches Skia `SkFont::Edging::kAlias`:
  - `dc.SetTextMode(gg.TextModeAliased)` — new TextMode value
  - GlyphMask (Tier 6): `NoAAFiller` for binary glyph masks
  - MSDF (Tier 4): `step(0.5)` shader for hard edges
  - Separate from geometry AA (`SetAntiAlias`) — matches Skia/Cairo separation

  ```go
  dc.SetTextMode(gg.TextModeAliased)
  dc.DrawString("Pixel Perfect", x, y)  // no gray edge pixels
  ```

### Fixed

- **Text invisible on clipped sibling elements** (#335, #338, #339, #340, @celer) — batch
  coalescing (ADR-031) merged same-style text across scissor boundaries. Per-tier seal
  flags (`textBatchSealed`, `glyphBatchSealed`) now prevent merging across clip changes.
  Both Tier 4 (MSDF) and Tier 6 (GlyphMask) covered. Intra-group merging preserved.

- **NaN/Inf stack overflow in curve subdivision** (ADR-035, #341, @rcarlier) — 12 recursive
  curve flattening functions across 4 files now have `depth > 10` guards (16 for arc length).
  Prevents stack overflow on NaN/Inf coordinates. 18 NaN/Inf safety tests.

- **DrawRegularPolygon rotation** (#334, @rcarlier) — fogleman/gg compatibility: odd-sided
  polygons (triangle, pentagon) vertex pointing up at rotation=0, even-sided (square,
  hexagon) flat top. 5 vertex positioning tests.

### Performance

- **Zero-alloc stroke path** — `strokeResultToPath` reuses scratch `Path` on
  `SoftwareRenderer` (Skia `fOuter.reset()` pattern). StrokePath: 1 → 0 allocs, 4.3× faster.

- **Zero-alloc paint color** (ADR-036) — `SetRGB`/`SetRGBA`/`SetHexColor` now write
  directly to inline `solidColor RGBA` value field on Paint, bypassing interface boxing
  and `*SolidPattern` heap allocation (Skia `fColor4f` dual-field pattern).
  SetRGB: 2 → 0 allocs. ComplexScene: 80 → 68 allocs (-15%).

### Changed

- **Dependencies** — wgpu v0.28.6 (GLES hidden window context), gogpu v0.38.0
  (PlatformProvider delegation, SurfaceState lifecycle).

## [0.47.4] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **`NewPixmapFromBuffer(buf, width, height)`** (#336, @huanfeng) — wrap a caller-owned
  premultiplied-RGBA buffer as a Pixmap without allocating. Enables zero-copy buffer reuse
  in hot rendering loops (e.g., software IME at 60fps). Integer overflow guard protects
  32-bit platforms. Follows Skia `SkPixmap` / Go `image.RGBA.SubImage` aliasing pattern.

- **`(*Pixmap).ImageView()`** (#336, @huanfeng) — zero-copy alternative to `ToImage()`.
  Returns `*image.RGBA` whose `Pix` aliases the pixmap's buffer. O(1) with no data copy.

## [0.47.3] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **HiDPI quarter-screen rendering** (#327, #332, @unxed) — `trackDamage()` recorded
  damage rects in logical coordinates, but OS compositor APIs (Vulkan
  `VK_KHR_incremental_present`, DX12 `Present1`, EGL) expect physical pixels.
  Compositor updated only the logical area (800×600) instead of the full physical
  surface (1600×1200). Fix: scale damage rects by `deviceScale` with Floor/Ceil
  conservative rounding. Guard uses `deviceMatrix.IsIdentity()` (enterprise pattern).

- **`SetPresentDamage()` coordinate mismatch** (BUG-GG-DAMAGE-COORDS-001) — documentation
  said "physical pixels" but callers (ui widget tree) passed logical coordinates.
  Fix: scale logical→physical inside `SetPresentDamage()`, corrected documentation.

### Added

- **9 damage scaling regression tests** — HiDPI scale 2.0/3.0/1.5, partial rect,
  fractional coords, stroke, multiple rects, public API (`TrackDamageRect`).

## [0.47.2] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **ggcanvas.Draw() per-frame state reset** (#328, @unxed) — `Draw()` now wraps
  the user closure with `Push()/Identity()/ClearPath()/Pop()` (Skia SkAutoCanvasRestore
  pattern, ADR-032). Matrix transforms, paths, and clips no longer accumulate across
  frames. Configuration state (font, paint color, textMode) persists as expected.

### Added

- **Draw state reset tests** — 5 tests: matrix reset, path clear, font persistence,
  Push unwind, multi-frame stability (10 frames with drift detection).

## [0.47.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **Text rendering performance: batch coalescing** (#322, @unxed) — consecutive
  `DrawString` calls with the same transform/color/atlas page now merge into a single
  GPU draw call. Previously each call produced a separate batch → 2400 individual
  `DrawString("A")` calls generated 2400 GPU draw calls (~55ms on Intel HD 520).
  With coalescing: 1 draw call (~2ms). Architecture: ADR-031, enterprise pattern
  (Skia `SkTextBlob` → `DirectMaskSubRun`, Chrome text blob batching).

  Applies to both Tier 6 (GlyphMask) and Tier 4 (MSDF) text pipelines.

### Added

- **HiDPI dimension warning in ggcanvas.New()** (#322) — warns when passed dimensions
  appear to be physical pixels instead of logical, catching the common mistake of using
  `FramebufferWidth/Height` instead of `Width/Height` on HiDPI displays.

- **Batch coalescing tests** — 15 tests for `CanMerge` + coalescing behavior
  (same-style merge, different-color/transform/LCD/atlas no-merge, mixed sequences).
  6 tests for HiDPI dimension warning detection.

## [0.47.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Pixel-Perfect Mode (Anti-Aliasing Toggle)** — `dc.SetAntiAlias(false)` disables
  anti-aliasing for geometry rendering, producing crisp aliased edges with binary
  coverage (fully inside or fully outside). Use cases: pixel art, retro-style graphics,
  L-System fractals, technical drawings, sharp grid lines. (#319, @rcarlier)

  - **API:** `Context.SetAntiAlias(enabled bool)` / `Context.AntiAlias() bool`.
    Context-level state, participates in Push/Pop. Text AA remains independent (TextMode).
  - **CPU:** Dedicated `NoAAFiller` — integer scanline walker with `FixedRoundToInt`
    edge rounding. Completely separate code path (Skia `SkScan::FillPath` / tiny-skia
    `scan::path` pattern), ~2-3× faster than analytic AA.
  - **GPU SDF:** Binary step coverage via `anti_alias` uniform flag. Shapes render
    with hard pixel edges on all backends (Vulkan, DX12, Metal, GLES, Software).
  - **Recording:** `Recorder.SetAntiAlias()` mirrors the Context API for vector export.
  - **Architecture:** ADR-030, based on research of 5 enterprise engines (Skia, Cairo,
    tiny-skia, Vello, femtovg). All use separate non-AA code paths, not threshold on
    AA output.

  ```go
  dc.SetAntiAlias(false)  // all subsequent draws — pixel-perfect
  dc.DrawRectangle(10, 10, 100, 50)
  dc.Fill()               // binary fill, no gray edge pixels
  dc.SetAntiAlias(true)   // back to smooth AA
  ```

## [0.46.11] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **GPU scene renderer ignores affine scale for images** (ui#101 Thread C, @AnyCPU) —
  `resolveImage` in `scene/gpu_renderer.go` used only translation (C, F) from the
  affine transform, ignoring scale components (A, E). On HiDPI displays where the
  scene encodes an inverse-DPI affine, SVG icons rendered ~2x too large. CPU scene
  renderer handled this correctly. Fix: use `DrawImageEx` with `DstWidth/DstHeight`
  computed from affine scale.

- **GPU stroke of curved paths renders as filled lens** (ui#101 Thread F, @AnyCPU) —
  `StrokePath` expanded curved strokes (arcs, beziers) to filled outlines via
  `FillPath` → stencil-then-cover. Fan tessellation created incorrect stencil
  coverage for ring-shaped stroke outlines, rendering arcs as chord-closed filled
  lenses. Affected `CircularProgress` widget in M3 theme (v0.44.0+ regression).
  Fix: use EvenOdd fill rule for stroke-expanded outlines — ring interior crosses
  2 boundaries (even = empty), stroke band crosses 1 (odd = filled). Skia Ganesh
  pattern for GPU stroke rendering.

- **Vulkan crash on stale texture in readback barrier** (ui#101) — `encodeSubmitReadback`
  and `encodeSubmitReadbackGrouped` passed `resolveTex` to `TransitionTextures`
  without nil check. Concurrent resize destroying textures between `ensureTextures`
  and barrier caused NULL VkImage → `vkCmdPipelineBarrier` crash (Exception 0xc0000005).
  Fix: nil texture guard in all three readback functions.

### Added

- **`Path.HasCurves()`** — reports whether a path contains quadratic or cubic curves.

- **GPU scene image scale tests** — `TestGPUSceneRenderer_ImageRespectsAffineScale`,
  `TestGPUSceneRenderer_ImageIdentityScale`, `TestGPUSceneRenderer_ImageScale2x`.
  Pixel-level verification that DrawImage honors affine scale components.

- **HasCurves tests** — 5 table-driven tests for `Path.HasCurves()`.

- **Nil texture readback tests** — `TestReadbackGrouped_NilTexturesReturnsError`,
  `TestReadback_NilTexturesReturnsError`, `TestCopySubmitAndReadback_NilResolveTexReturnsError`.
  Verify error return instead of crash when textures destroyed.

- **SA5011 staticcheck fixes** — added `return` after `t.Fatal`/`t.Skip` in 5 test files
  (11 locations) to satisfy newer staticcheck nil pointer analysis.

### Changed

- **Dependencies** — wgpu v0.27.3 → v0.27.5 (defensive NULL handle guard in
  TransitionTextures, goffi v0.5.1 struct ABI), gogpu v0.34.3 → v0.34.4
  (macOS TextField fix), x/image v0.39.0 → v0.40.0, x/text v0.36.0 → v0.37.0.

## [0.46.9] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Mac Retina renders only upper-left quadrant** (gg#308, @sverrehu) — `MarkDirty()`
  set `dirtyRect` to logical pixel dimensions (`Width()/Height()`) instead of physical
  (`PixelWidth()/PixelHeight()`). On Retina (scale=2.0), this caused `uploadTexture()`
  to do a partial upload of only 1/4 of the pixmap, rendering the upper-left quadrant
  only. First frame was unaffected because initial texture creation uses full data.
  Regression introduced in v0.45.4 (BUG-GG-LASTDAMAGE-001 fix).

### Added

- **HiDPI regression tests** — `TestMarkDirty_HiDPI_UsesPhysicalDimensions`,
  `TestFlush_HiDPI_FullUploadAfterMarkDirty`, `TestMarkDirtyRegion_HiDPI_PartialUpload`
  with `mockHiDPIProvider` (scale=2.0). Prevents future logical/physical coordinate
  mismatches in texture upload path.
  lines-only, quadratic, cubic, and mixed paths.

## [0.46.8] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- **CJK improvements bypassed through scene/shaper paths** — `ShapedGlyph.IsCJK` field
  (ADR-027) was never populated, silently disabling script-aware hinting, exact-size
  rasterization, and Tier 6 routing for CJK text rendered through scene or UI compositor.
  Fixed in 6 locations: builtin shaper, HarfBuzz shaper, LayoutText, scene encoding
  (`TextFlagCJK` in `GlyphRunData.Flags`), scene GPU/CPU decoders. Zero breaking changes,
  no UI modifications needed — fix is transparent through `scene.DrawText` API.

## [0.46.7] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Multi-rect damage** (ADR-028) — per-draw dynamic scissor for distant dirty regions.
  Base layer drawn once per damage rect instead of one union rect. Distant widgets:
  97% fewer tiles loaded (200K → 5.5K pixels on TBDR GPUs).
  - `FlushGPUWithViewDamageRects(view, w, h, rects []image.Rectangle)`
  - `RenderDirectWithDamageRects(sv, w, h, rects []image.Rectangle)`
  - `GPURenderTarget.DamageRects` replaces `DamageRect` (backward compatible)
  - Both `encodeBlitOnlyPass` and `encodeBlitToEncoder` updated

- **`multi_damage_demo` example** — two animated elements at opposite corners,
  visualizes per-draw dynamic scissor with `GOGPU_DEBUG_DAMAGE=1`.

### Changed

- **Dependencies** — wgpu v0.27.2 → v0.27.3, gogpu v0.34.0 → v0.34.3.

## [0.46.6] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **CJK text rendering strategy** (ADR-027) — enterprise-level CJK font quality matching
  Skia/FreeType/DirectWrite/Core Text patterns. Five changes:
  1. **Script-aware hinting** — CJK glyphs use `HintingVertical` at 1x scale (FreeType
     `afcjk` pattern) or `HintingNone` at 2x+ (macOS Core Text). Full grid-fitting
     collapsed thin CJK parallel strokes.
  2. **CJK bucket bypass** — CJK glyphs always rasterize at exact requested size, never
     bucket-quantized. Skia DirectMask never buckets bitmap glyphs.
  3. **Force Tier 6 for CJK ≤64px** — CJK body text routes to bitmap (Tier 6) instead of
     MSDF (Tier 4). No production engine uses MSDF for CJK body text.
  4. **Dual MSDF atlas** — separate 128px/2048×2048 atlas for CJK display text (>64px).
     MapLibre 2x resolution pattern. Per-glyph routing via `IsCJKRune`.
  5. **Atlas MaxEntries 16384** — doubled for CJK workloads (20K+ glyphs × subpixel variants).

- **`text.IsCJKRune(r)`** — exported CJK script detection for cross-package use.

- **`ShapedGlyph.IsCJK`** — carries CJK script flag through the GPU text pipeline for
  per-glyph rendering decisions without re-scanning text.

- **TrueType Collection (.ttc/.otc) support** — font parser automatically detects
  collections and extracts font by index. `WithCollectionIndex(i)` option for explicit
  selection. Most CJK system fonts are collections (msyh.ttc, simsun.ttc, PingFang.ttc).

- **`cjk_text` example** — visual validation of CJK text at body + display sizes.

### Changed

- **Dependencies** — wgpu v0.27.1 → v0.27.2.

### Research

- `CJK-TEXT-RENDERING-ENTERPRISE-RESEARCH.md` — Skia, FreeType, DirectWrite, Core Text,
  Vello, MapLibre analysis. Key finding: no production engine uses MSDF for CJK body text.

## [0.46.5] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`Canvas.RenderDirectWithDamage(surfaceView, w, h, damage)`** — damage-aware surface
  compositing. Uses `LoadOpLoad + SetScissorRect` to preserve previous frame content outside
  the damage rect. Enables per-boundary incremental updates (99.5% bandwidth reduction for
  48×48 spinner on 800×600 surface).

- **`Context.TrackDamageRect(rect)`** — public API for compositors to report damage from
  retained-mode operations (DrawGPUTexture overlay blits). Enterprise pattern matching
  Chrome Viz DamageTracker and Flutter DiffContext — compositor reports damage, renderer
  consumes it.

- **`computeDamageScissor`** — pure function for scissor-damage intersection with surface
  clamping. 10 table-driven tests, CI-ready without GPU hardware.

- **E2E damage blit tests via software backend** — pixel-exact verification of LoadOpLoad +
  scissor through wgpu software backend. `createSoftwareDevice()` helper for headless CI.

### Fixed

- **Debug overlay feedback loop** — `GOGPU_DEBUG_DAMAGE=1` created infinite 30fps render
  loop when combined with `TrackDamageRect`: same rect every frame → new flash → fade →
  NeedsAnimationFrame → RequestRedraw → loop. Fixed via refresh-on-match: active flash
  for same rect refreshes timestamp instead of creating duplicate. Region stays highlighted
  while updating, fade begins when updates stop. Android SurfaceFlinger pattern.

- **Overlay scissor reset corrupted LoadOpLoad content** — `applyGroupScissor(nil)` reset
  scissor to full surface, drawing overlays outside damage rect. Fixed via
  `applyGroupScissorWithDamage` which intersects group clip with damage rect. Returns false
  on empty intersection (Vulkan VUID-vkCmdSetScissor-x-00595 compliant — no zero-size scissor).

- **`encodeBlitToEncoder` (ADR-017) missing overlay damage scissor** — shared encoder path
  had same overlay loop without any scissor for overlays. Same fix applied.

- **Base layer scissor clamped to surface bounds** — `encodeBlitOnlyPass` and
  `encodeBlitToEncoder` now use `computeDamageScissor` for proper surface clamping.

## [0.46.4] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **Text ortho projection deferred to flush time** (ADR-025, Skia `sk_RTAdjust` pattern) —
  Tier 4 (MSDF) and Tier 6 (GlyphMask) previously baked ortho projection at draw time
  using context pixmap dimensions. When `FlushGPUWithView` rendered to offscreen textures
  (RepaintBoundary), text was squished/mispositioned. Now ortho is computed at flush time
  from `effectiveDimensions()`, matching SDF/Convex/Stencil/Image tiers and Skia/Vello
  enterprise pattern. CPU-side fix, zero shader changes.

- **Scissor groups applied to GPU texture overlays in blit-only path** — `encodeBlitOnlyPass`
  had scissor group infrastructure but was not applying it to GPU texture overlay draws.
  RepaintBoundary textures (e.g., ListView items) rendered outside their parent viewport
  when composited via the non-MSAA blit path.

## [0.46.3] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **`scene.NewAffine(a, b, c, d, e, f)`** — general-purpose affine constructor for
  arbitrary transforms (scale + translate for SVG icon rendering).

- **`scene.NewGGPathShape(*gg.Path)`** — bridge from `gg.Path` (float64) to scene
  `PathShape` (float32). Enables direct use of `gg.ParseSVGPath` results in scene
  `Fill` operations without manual conversion.

### Changed

- **Dependencies** — gogpu v0.33.0 → v0.34.0.

## [0.46.2] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **ClearType LCD auto-detection** (ADR-024) — ggcanvas automatically detects display
  subpixel layout via `gpucontext.PlatformProvider.SubpixelLayout()` and enables LCD
  text rendering. Windows: `SystemParametersInfoW` + registry (RGB/BGR). macOS: grayscale
  (subpixel killed in Mojave 10.14). Linux: `Xft.rgba` / `wl_output.subpixel`. Text
  quality now matches native Windows DirectWrite / Chrome ClearType. Zero configuration
  required — works automatically when using gogpu windowing.

### Fixed

- **Examples GPU-direct background** — replaced CPU `Clear()` with GPU `Fill()` in 6
  examples (lcd_text, scene_gpu_visual, clip_path, clip_demo, damage_demo,
  gogpu_integration). CPU Clear is invisible in GPU-direct render mode because
  `RenderDirect` only presents GPU commands, not the CPU pixmap.

### Changed

- **Dependencies** — gpucontext v0.17.0 → v0.18.0 (PlatformProvider.SubpixelLayout),
  gogpu v0.32.3 → v0.33.0 (SubpixelLayout platform detection).

## [0.46.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **GPU scene renderer: TagImage was silently discarded** — `_, _ = dec.Image()` caused
  all scene images to be invisible in GPU rendering path. Now renders via `dc.DrawImage`.

- **GPU scene renderer: PushLayer blend mode + alpha ignored** — `dc.Push()` replaced
  with `dc.PushLayer(blend, alpha)` / `dc.PopLayer()`. Layer blend modes and opacity
  now applied correctly.

- **Silent data discards eliminated** — all `_, _ =` patterns in production scene
  renderer code replaced with proper handling or documented skips.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **Scene text via TagText glyph references** (ADR-022) — scene retained-mode text
  now stores compact glyph references (10 bytes/glyph) instead of full vector paths
  (~300 bytes/glyph). Shaping happens once at recording time; resolution deferred to
  render time. GPU scene renderer routes through `DrawShapedGlyphs` → Tier 6/4
  auto-selection for hinted, atlas-batched, DPI-aware text. CPU tile renderer extracts
  outlines from stored glyphs as fallback. 30× smaller scene encoding for text-heavy
  content. Breaking change: `Scene.DrawGlyphs()` signature updated.

- **`DrawShapedGlyphs` on Context** — new public method for rendering pre-shaped glyphs
  without re-shaping. Implements the ADR-022 "shape once, render anywhere" guarantee.
  `GPUShapedTextAccelerator` optional interface (composition pattern). Matches Skia
  `drawTextBlob`, Vello `draw_glyphs`, Flutter `drawParagraph` enterprise pattern.

- **Font registry on Scene** — `Scene.RegisterFont()` / `Scene.FontRegistry()` maps
  FontSourceID → `*text.FontSource` for cross-context font sharing. Merged correctly
  in `Scene.Append` / `Scene.AppendWithTranslation`.

### Fixed

- **Glyph mask atlas zoom resilience** (ui#94) — three-mechanism atlas protection
  (Skia/Chrome pattern): (1) size bucket quantization — under atlas pressure, snap to
  4 discrete sizes (16/24/32/48px), reducing entries from ~57K to ~416 during zoom;
  (2) page-level reclamation — `evictTail()` resets pages when all entries evicted,
  reclaiming shelf allocator space; (3) frame-based `Compact()` — pages unused for 32+
  frames are reset automatically (Skia `kPlotRecentlyUsedCount` pattern). Atlas
  self-heals after zoom. Hysteresis prevents oscillation (enter bucketed at 50%, exit
  at 25%).

- **Bucketed mode quad scaling** — glyphs rasterized at bucket size with scale factor
  (`actualSize/bucketSize`) applied to quad positioning. Matches Skia
  `strikeToSourceScale` pattern from `SubRunControl.cpp`.

- **FontSourceID hash strengthened** — now includes `FullName` + `UnitsPerEm` (was
  `Name` + `NumGlyphs` only). Reduces collision risk for fonts with similar metadata.

- **CPU tile renderer TagText fallback** — uses stored glyph positions from scene
  encoding instead of re-shaping. Extracted `transformScenePath` helper.

- **TextLen overflow** — `Scene.DrawText` returns error for strings >65535 bytes
  (was silent truncation).

### Removed

- **`TextRenderer.RenderToScene` / `RenderTextToScene`** — replaced by TagText
  encoding. `TextRenderer.RenderGlyphs` / `RenderText` remain for direct outline use.

## [0.45.4] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- **Multi-flush offscreen texture trails** (BUG-GG-MULTI-FLUSH-001) — two bugs:
  premature command buffer free mid-frame (`prevCmdBuf` → `prevCmdBufs[]`, deferred
  to next BeginFrame) + MSAA textures destroyed while in-flight (GPU drain on size
  change). Per-boundary GPU texture compositing now works correctly.

- **ClipRoundRect not applied on software backend** (BUG-CLIP-001) — `applyClipToPaint()`
  called after `tryGPUFill()`, so CPU clip path skipped when SDF fallback succeeded.
  Fix: moved clip/mask setup before GPU attempt. Also: `sdf_accelerator.blendPixel()`
  now modulates coverage by clip + mask SDF per-pixel. 7 new tests.

- **Bind group released before submit with shared encoder** (BUG-GG-BINDGROUP-LIFETIME-001) —
  `buildGPUTextureResources()` released old bind groups immediately. With shared
  command encoder, pending command buffer still referenced them. Fix: deferred release
  via `pendingBindGroupRelease` + `releasePendingBindGroups()` after submit.

- **MarkDirty() returned empty damage rect** (BUG-GG-LASTDAMAGE-001) — set `dirtyRect`
  to empty instead of full canvas dimensions. `LastDamage()` returned 0×0.
  Fix: `image.Rect(0, 0, width, height)`.

### Added

- **Damage-aware present** (ADR-021 Phase 4) — `Canvas.SetPresentDamage()` accepts
  damage rects from retained-mode callers (ui widget tree). `forwardDamageRects()`
  forwards to gogpu `SetDamageRects()` → wgpu `PresentWithDamage()` → OS compositor
  (VK_KHR_incremental_present, DX12 Present1, eglSwapBuffersWithDamage). Falls back
  to immediate-mode `FrameDamage()` when explicit rects not provided. Both GPU-direct
  and universal present paths covered. 6 new tests.

- **Overlay-only blit path** (BUG-GG-OVERLAY-ONLY-BLIT-001) — `DrawGPUTexture` without
  `DrawGPUTextureBase` silently produced no output. Two bugs: (1) `GPUTextureCommands`
  missing from `totalItems` check → overlay-only frame skipped as "empty"; (2) `isBlitOnly`
  required base layer → overlay-only fell through to MSAA path. Unblocks L3 damage
  pipeline: compositor LoadOpLoad + scissor + overlay-only = preserved base + new overlay.

- **FlushGPUWithViewDamage MSAA path warning** (ADR-021) — `damageRect` was silently
  ignored when MSAA render path was used (vector shapes via Fill/Stroke). Now logs
  warning: "damageRect ignored: MSAA render path requires full LoadOpClear". Updated
  godoc to document blit-only limitation. LoadOpLoad + scissor verified working on
  offscreen blit-only compositor path (Chrome/Flutter pattern).

### Changed

- **Dependencies** — examples updated to gogpu v0.32.3 (D2 demand-driven rendering,
  ADR-023 three-mode frame scheduling).

## [0.45.3] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- **GPUSceneRenderer TagStroke missing LineCap/LineJoin/MiterLimit** — only
  `SetLineWidth` was applied from scene StrokeStyle. Arc strokes (spinner)
  rendered as filled wedges instead of rounded arcs because LineCap defaulted
  to Butt instead of Round.

## [0.45.2] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **`SetDamageTracking()` API** — retained-mode damage suppression for scene-based
  rendering (ADR-021). Enables per-object dirty tracking for efficient repaints.

- **Flash-and-fade damage overlay** (`GOGPU_DEBUG_DAMAGE=1`) — visual debug overlay
  for damage regions (ADR-021 Phase 6a).

### Fixed

- **GPU clip broken by transform Push/Pop inside clip region** (BUG-GG-GPU-SCENE-CLIP-001) —
  GPUSceneRenderer used Push/Pop for BOTH transforms and clips. TagTransform inside
  BeginClip/EndClip popped the clip's Push, destroying the clip. Fix: transforms use
  SetTransform (direct matrix replacement), Push/Pop reserved for clip/layer boundaries.

- **Rect clips → hardware scissor instead of depth clip** — GPUSceneRenderer used
  dc.Clip() (PushPath) for rectangular clips → depth clip path. Fix: DetectShape()
  detects rect → dc.ClipRect() → PushRect → hardware scissor (always works, zero overhead).

- **Scene Append/AppendWithTranslation write to currentEncoding** — layer-aware
  encoding for correct clip/content ordering.

- **FlushGPUWithView returns ErrFallbackToCPU** when GPU unavailable (ADR-022).

- **Damage overlay drawn before GPU-direct path** (all backends).

- **Nested clip Push/Pop in GPUSceneRenderer** + GPU test skip.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** examples updated to gogpu v0.32.2, wgpu v0.27.0, gpucontext v0.17.0,
  naga v0.17.11
- Green damage overlay via gg.Context instead of direct pixmap manipulation

## [0.45.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- **ggcanvas: trail artifacts in normal mode** — `Draw()` now calls `MarkDirty()` (resets `dirtyRect`) instead of just `c.dirty = true`. Per-rect `PresentWithDamage` disabled for immediate mode — `FrameDamage()` captures only new positions, missing old positions where objects were. Full present correct for immediate mode. Per-rect present requires retained-mode `DamageTracker` (computes old+new bounds).

## [0.45.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Four-level damage pipeline** (ADR-021) — enterprise dirty region tracking: Object Diff → Tile Dirty → GPU Scissor → OS Present. `DamageTracker` computes frame-to-frame bounding box diff. `Renderer.RenderWithDamage()` renders only dirty tiles. Per-command bounds in scene `Encoding`. References: Android `SkRegion`, Wayland damage protocol, Flutter `RepaintBoundary`.
- **Incremental `Path.Bounds()`** — bounding box computed during path construction (Skia `SkPathRef::fBounds` pattern). O(1) per MoveTo/LineTo/CubicTo. Zero extra cost vs computing at Fill() time.
- **`Context.FrameDamage()`** — returns `[]image.Rectangle` list of per-operation damage rects. Individual rects passed to `PresentWithDamage` for per-rect OS blit. Threshold: >16 rects merged to bounding box (Swiss cheese prevention).
- **`canvas.LastDamage()`** — public API for damage rect access on ggcanvas.
- **`DamageRectSetter`** interface — ggcanvas passes damage rects to gogpu `SetDamageRects()` → wgpu `PresentWithDamage()`.
- **`GOGPU_DEBUG_DAMAGE=1`** — debug overlay showing green semi-transparent rectangles on damage regions. Android SurfaceFlinger pattern: full recompose per debug frame, no trail. Zero overhead when disabled.
- **`GOGPU_RENDER_MODE=auto|cpu|gpu`** — adapter-aware render mode (ADR-020). CPU rasterizer on software adapter (60 FPS vs 0.65 FPS), GPU on real hardware. `AdapterAware` interface.
- **Damage demo example** — `examples/damage_demo/`: static rects + bouncing circle + frame counter. Two independent damage rects visible with debug overlay. 177 FPS on software backend.

### Fixed

- **Software backend GPU accelerator** — disable GPU accelerator on software/CPU adapter via `softwareMode` flag. Prevents SDF shader path from intercepting when CPU rasterizer is faster.

### Changed

- **deps:** wgpu v0.27.0 (SPIR-V interpreter, blit fix), naga v0.17.11, gpucontext v0.17.0 (AdapterInfo)

## [0.44.1] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **dc.Clip() GPU bridge** — `dc.Clip()` with arbitrary paths (circles, beziers,
  polygons) now routes to GPU depth clip instead of falling back to CPU. At-draw-time
  pattern (Skia Graphite/Impeller): path stored at Clip() time, dispatched to GPU at
  Fill/Stroke time. Two-level clipping: scissor rect + depth buffer.
  New `PathClipAware` interface. CPU fallback preserved.

- **`clip_path` example** — visual test for GPU-CLIP-003a: circle clip, star clip,
  no-clip reference. Demonstrates arbitrary path clipping on GPU.

### Fixed

- **Stencil-then-cover-to-depth for non-convex clips** — fan tessellation direct
  depth write was wrong for non-convex paths (star). Now uses two-phase algorithm:
  Phase 1 stencil fill (winding number), Phase 2 cover quad (depth write where
  stencil ≠ 0, stencil reset to 0). Skia Ganesh pattern.

- **Shared depth clip buffers overwritten between groups** — `BuildClipResources()`
  uploaded to pipeline-level shared buffers. Multiple clip groups overwrote each
  other (circle → star data). Fix: per-group owned buffers with Release() cleanup.

- **ClipPath dropped in Flush() deep-copy** — ScissorGroup deep-copy missing ClipPath
  and ClipDepthLevel fields → depth clip never activated.

- **DepthLoadOp=Load reads undefined after Discard** — depth buffer garbage on frame
  2+ caused depth test failures. Fix: always clear depth (never load discarded data).

### Changed

- Pixel-level CPU clip tests + GPU bridge tests (29 clip tests total)

## [0.44.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **GPU-CLIP-003a: Depth-based arbitrary path clipping** — clip paths rendered to
  depth buffer (Z=0.0, ColorWriteMask=None) before content; all GPU tiers test
  DepthCompare=GreaterEqual to reject fragments outside clip region. Follows
  Flutter Impeller (PR #50856) / Skia Graphite pattern: depth for clip, stencil
  exclusively for Tier 2b path fill (zero conflict). Enables arbitrary path
  clipping for ui widget tree via `ScissorGroup.ClipPath`.

- **dc.Clip() GPU bridge** — `dc.Clip()` with arbitrary paths (circles, beziers,
  polygons) now routes to GPU depth clip instead of falling back to CPU. At-draw-time
  pattern (Skia Graphite/Impeller): path stored at Clip() time, dispatched to GPU at
  Fill/Stroke time via `SetClipPath()`. Two-level clipping: scissor rect (bounding box)
  + depth buffer (precise path). CPU fallback preserved when GPU unavailable.
  New `PathClipAware` interface. 8 bridge tests.

  New files: `depth_clip.go`, `shaders/depth_clip.wgsl`
  Pipeline variants: SDF, convex, image, MSDF text, glyph mask, stencil fill/cover
  (all 6 renderers). Lazy creation — no overhead when ClipPath unused.

- **GPU-CLIP-003b: Vello coarse.wgsl clip tag dispatch** — `DRAWTAG_BEGIN_CLIP`
  and `DRAWTAG_END_CLIP` handling in GPU coarse shader. BeginClip: tile coverage
  check + `clip_zero_depth` optimization (suppress draws in empty clip tiles).
  EndClip: clip path coverage + blend/alpha emission. Matches CPU `coarse.go`.
  Prerequisite for full GPU compute clip pipeline (GPU-CLIP-003d).

### Architecture

- **Dual-approach clip strategy** (GPU-CLIP-003-DUAL-APPROACH-RESEARCH.md):
  depth-based for retained-mode (scene/ui), stencil bit partition for immediate-mode
  (dc.Clip, future GPU-CLIP-003c), Vello blend stack for compute (Tier 5, already working).
  Research: 3 parallel agents analyzed Skia Ganesh/Graphite, Flutter Impeller, Vello source.
  All three approaches coexist without conflicts (different buffer planes).

## [0.43.7] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- **deps:** wgpu v0.26.12 (test coverage boost, Metal entry point fix, naga v0.17.10), gpucontext v0.16.0 (WindowChrome.SetFullscreen/IsFullscreen), gogpu v0.31.0 (runtime fullscreen) in examples

## [0.43.6] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **Mac Retina: text half-size in CPU bitmap path** ([#276](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/276)) —
  `drawStringBitmap` (translation-only tier 0) rendered text with user-space font
  size on device-space pixmap. On Retina/HiDPI (2x), 24px text appeared as 12px.
  Fix: create device-scaled face (`size * deviceScale`) matching Skia and Cairo
  pattern. Reported by @sverrehu.

## [0.43.5] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.26.8 → v0.26.10 (Validation Phase B: MinBindingSize,
  DrawIndexed format, indirect buffer validation, depth/stencil aspect granularity,
  bind group destruction tracking at submit — 5 P1 checks, 45% coverage),
  gogpu v0.30.0 → v0.30.3 (multi-window deadlock fix + scroll fix),
  naga v0.17.6 → v0.17.8 (transitive)
- **Examples:** all 8 examples updated to latest ecosystem deps

## [0.43.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`Scene.AppendWithTranslation()`** — merges a child scene into a parent with
  (dx, dy) coordinate offset. All pathData coordinates (MoveTo, LineTo, QuadTo,
  CubicTo, FillRoundRect) are offset at append time. Transform stream copied
  verbatim (our architecture pre-bakes coordinates, unlike Vello which uses
  transform composition). Panic on unknown tags for exhaustiveness safety.
  8 tests covering all coordinate tags, bounds, transforms, nil/empty.

- **`Encoding.AppendWithTranslation()`** — encoding-level merge with coordinate
  offset + brush/image index adjustment. Enables ADR-007 Phase 5 scene
  composition in ui (RepaintBoundary at local coordinates → parent scene at offset).

## [0.43.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`DrawGPUTextureWithOpacity()`** — GPU texture overlay with alpha blending
  for fade transitions and OpacityLayer compositing (Flutter pattern).
  Internal pipeline already supported opacity — only the public API was missing.

- **`Scene.Append()`** — merges two scenes including encodings, image registries,
  and bounds. Image indices in the appended scene are adjusted to prevent
  cross-scene image reference corruption (TASK-GG-SCENE-005). Flutter
  `SceneBuilder.addPicture()` equivalent for retained-mode compositing.

- **`Encoding.AppendWithImages()`** — encoding-level merge with image index offset.
  `Encoding.Append()` unchanged (backward compatible, delegates with offset=0).

### Fixed

- **GPUSceneRenderer: SetPath bypasses CTM** (BUG-GG-GPU-SCENE-RENDERER-TEXT-001) —
  `SetPath(path)` copies raw coordinates without applying user transform matrix.
  Text and shapes rendered at wrong position (invisible when translated).
  Fix: `FillPath(path)` / `StrokePath(path)` which apply CTM via `DrawPath`.
  Also: `dc.Identity()` in TagTransform reset parent CTM → replaced with Push/Pop.
  Added TagFillRoundRect handler (was silently dropped).

- **GPUSceneRenderer: transform stack corruption** (BUG-002) — `transformDepth`
  counter incremented for every TagTransform but only one push was active.
  Cleanup popped N times instead of 1, corrupting parent transform stack.
  ListView items all rendered at first position. Fix: `if depth > 0` not `for range`.

- **Blit LoadOp ignores damageRect after BeginGPUFrame** (BUG-GG-BLIT-LOADOP-003) —
  `encodeBlitOnlyPass` required `s.frameRendered==true` for `LoadOpLoad`, but
  `BeginGPUFrame` always resets to false. Damage rect ignored → full surface blit
  every frame (22% GPU for spinner). Fix: non-empty damageRect alone triggers
  `LoadOpLoad` — caller guarantees swapchain warmup.

- **Encoding.Append image index corruption** (TASK-GG-SCENE-005) — `TagImage`
  drawData indices not adjusted when merging encodings. Scene B images pointed
  to scene A images after merge (data corruption).

- **Auto-hinter collapses thin horizontal stems at 12px** (BUG-GG-TEXT-HINTING-STEM-COLLAPSE-001) —
  `buildYSnapMap` snapped Y-coordinates independently. Two edges forming a thin
  horizontal stem (T crossbar, E/F bars) could both round to the same pixel row,
  collapsing the feature to 0px. "T" at 12px rendered as "I". Fix: `enforceMinStemWidth()`
  detects collapsed pairs and enforces minimum 1px separation (FreeType pattern).

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.26.6 → v0.26.8 (DX12 buffer state tracking, Vulkan
  buffer mapping audit BUG-VK-009, pipeline overridable constants, zero-init
  workgroup memory); examples gogpu v0.29.4 → v0.30.0
- **Examples:** all examples updated to wgpu v0.26.8 + gogpu v0.30.0; resize handling
  added to all ggcanvas-based examples (blit_only, zero_readback, zero_readback_manual,
  scene_gpu_visual)

### Architecture

- **ADR-019:** Render pass blit (not DMA copy) for swapchain compositing.
  DMA `CopyTextureToTexture` rejected: fails on GLES + WebGPU (2/5 backends),
  driver-dependent on Vulkan. All enterprise frameworks (wgpu, Vello, Flutter,
  Chrome) use render pass. Research: `docs/dev/research/DMA-BLIT-VS-RENDER-PASS-RESEARCH.md`

## [0.43.2] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.26.4 → v0.26.6 (CopyTextureToTexture DMA copy,
  compute dispatch barriers VAL-008, workgroup validation VAL-009/VAL-010)
- **Examples dependencies:** all examples updated to gogpu v0.29.4 + wgpu v0.26.6

## [0.43.1] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Single command buffer compositor** (ADR-017, Flutter Impeller pattern) —
  `CreateSharedEncoder()`, `SetSharedEncoder()`, `SubmitSharedEncoder()` on Context.
  Complete lifecycle: create → set on each context → flush all → submit once.
  Multiple render sessions record passes into one encoder. One `Submit` per frame,
  zero Vulkan semaphore conflicts. `encodeToEncoder()` + `encodeBlitToEncoder()`
  in render session. Backward compatible: nil encoder = existing per-context submit.

- **`examples/blit_only/`** — standalone example demonstrating the non-MSAA blit-only
  compositor path (ADR-016). CPU-drawn content (FillRectCPU, SetPixelPremul circles,
  grid lines) uploaded via FlushPixmap and composited via DrawGPUTextureBase +
  FlushGPUWithView. No SDF shapes, no GPU text — isBlitOnly=true triggers the 1x
  render pass. This is the path `ui/desktop.go` uses for RepaintBoundary compositing.

- **Type-safe GPU resource handles** (ADR-018, Vulkan/Ebitengine opaque handle pattern) —
  `gpucontext.TextureView` and `gpucontext.CommandEncoder` are now `struct{ ptr unsafe.Pointer }`
  instead of `interface{}`. Zero `any` in GPU pipeline public API. Compile-time type
  safety: TextureView cannot be confused with CommandEncoder or other resource types.
  8 bytes, value type, zero allocations. GC-safe (unsafe.Pointer keeps object alive).
  Breaking: `FlushGPUWithView(view any, ...)` → `FlushGPUWithView(view gpucontext.TextureView, ...)`,
  `SetSharedEncoder(encoder any)` → `SetSharedEncoder(encoder gpucontext.CommandEncoder)`.
  Requires gpucontext v0.15.0.

### Fixed

- **Blit-only path black screen** — `RenderFrameGrouped` early-returned on
  `totalItems == 0` without checking `baseLayer`, silently skipping the entire
  blit render pass when a frame contained only a base layer texture with zero
  vector shapes. The non-MSAA fast path (ADR-016) was dead code for pure
  compositor frames. Fixed: `totalItems == 0 && baseLayer == nil`.

- **GPU texture resource leak** — `buildGPUTextureResources` allocated new vertex
  and uniform buffers every frame for base layer / overlay textures without releasing
  previous ones. GC eventually collected them (`Buffer released by GC` warnings), but
  GPU memory grew unbounded between collections. Fixed: session-level persistent buffers
  with grow-only reallocation (same pattern as SDF/convex/image/text tiers). Bind groups
  are recreated per frame (texture view changes) but uniform/vertex buffers are reused.

- **Nil-guard in CreateEncoder/SubmitEncoder** — nil session check prevents panic
  when GPU is not initialized.

- **GPU texture overlay stretched to full screen** (BUG-GG-GPU-TEXTURE-OVERLAY-SIZE) —
  `DrawGPUTexture(view, x, y, 48, 48)` rendered at ~300px instead of 48×48.
  Root cause: `buildGPUTextureResources` used a single shared vertex buffer
  (`gpuTexVertBuf`) for both base layer and overlay textures. Base layer
  (full-screen quad) overwrote overlay vertex positions. Fixed: separate
  `gpuTexBaseVertBuf` for base layer, `gpuTexVertBuf` for overlays.
  Regression test: `TestBuildGPUTextureResources_SeparateVertexBuffers`.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.26.2 → v0.26.4 (PresentWithDamage + auto-cleanup + VK-006 layout fix);
  gpucontext v0.14.0 → v0.15.0 (type-safe TextureView/CommandEncoder handles)
- **Breaking:** `FlushGPUWithView`, `FlushGPUWithViewDamage` — `view any` → `view gpucontext.TextureView`;
  `SetSharedEncoder`, `CreateSharedEncoder`, `SubmitSharedEncoder` — `any` → `gpucontext.CommandEncoder`;
  `ggcanvas.RenderTarget.SurfaceView()` — `any` → `gpucontext.TextureView`;
  `ggcanvas.RenderDirect` — `surfaceView any` → `surfaceView gpucontext.TextureView`.
  Nil checks: `view == nil` → `view.IsNil()`.
- **Examples dependencies:** all examples updated to gogpu v0.29.3 + wgpu v0.26.4
- **Enterprise GPU texture tests** — 14 new tests covering vertex positioning,
  ortho projection, command queueing, PendingCount, isBlitOnly detection, and
  regression guards for BUG-GG-BLIT-PATH-001 and BUG-GG-GPU-TEXTURE-OVERLAY-SIZE.

## [0.43.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Non-MSAA compositor fast path** (ADR-016) — when a frame contains only textured quads
  (base layer + overlays) with no vector shapes, uses a 1x render pass directly to swapchain
  instead of 4x MSAA render + resolve. 93% bandwidth reduction (116 MB/frame → 8 MB at 1080p).
  `isBlitOnly()` detection + `encodeBlitOnlyPass()` + `RecordBlitDraws()` with dedicated
  1x pipeline. Enterprise pattern: Flutter/Chrome/Qt all use non-MSAA compositor passes.

- **`FlushGPUWithViewDamage()`** (ADR-016 Phase 2) — damage-aware compositor. When damage
  rect is set, uses `LoadOpLoad` (preserve previous frame) + scissor-clip to dirty region.
  Only the damaged pixels are re-composited (48×48 spinner = 9KB vs 8MB full surface at 1080p).

- **`PixmapTextureView()`** in ggcanvas — returns the GPU texture view of the uploaded pixmap
  for single-pass zero-readback compositing via `DrawGPUTextureBase()`. Uses Go structural
  typing (duck typing) — no gogpu import required. Requires gogpu `Texture.TextureView()`.

- **`FillRectCPU()`** + **`Pixmap.FillRect()`** — CPU-only rectangle fill that bypasses the
  GPU SDF accelerator. Without this, dirty-region background clearing routes through SDF →
  blocks non-MSAA blit path (`isBlitOnly` = false). Enterprise pattern: Qt `fillRegion()`,
  Flutter `memset`, Chrome `glClear+scissor`. Premultiplied RGBA, device-scale aware, row-copy
  optimized (fill first row, `copy()` remaining).

- **`BeginGPUFrame()`** on Context — resets per-context GPU frame state for persistent contexts.
  Required when reusing a Context across frames with the same view (RepaintBoundary pattern).
  Without this, `frameRendered=true` from previous frame causes `LoadOpLoad` instead of
  `LoadOpClear`, preserving stale content.

- **`DrawGPUTextureBase()`** — compositor base layer: textured quad drawn BEFORE all GPU
  tiers in the render pass (ADR-015). Enables zero-readback rendering where CPU pixmap is
  the background and GPU shapes (SDF, text) render on top in a single pass. Flutter
  OffsetLayer pattern. Stencil/depth available across all tiers including base layer.

- **`FlushPixmap()`** in ggcanvas — uploads CPU pixmap to GPU texture without calling
  `FlushGPU()`. Pending GPU shapes remain queued for zero-readback rendering via
  `FlushGPUWithView()`. Enables ui ADR-006 Phase 1 (GPU <5% for spinner @60fps).
  Existing `Flush()` refactored to delegate to `FlushPixmap()` after `FlushGPU()`.

- **`EnsureGPUTexture()`** in ggcanvas — promotes pendingTexture to real GPU texture
  (one-time setup for zero-readback pipeline). Required before `PixmapTextureView()`.

### Changed

- **`gpuCtx` typed as `gpuContextOps`** — replaced `any` with compile-time type safety.
  Type assertion moved to `ensureGPUCtx()` (once at creation), `gpuCtxOps()` simplified
  to direct return.

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.25.7 → v0.26.2 (PresentWithDamage all backends +
  Buffer/BindGroup automatic cleanup via runtime.AddCleanup)

### Fixed

- **GPU global fallback warnings** — all 8 GPU code paths (Fill, Stroke, Text, Flush,
  Clip) that silently fall back to global `SDFAccelerator.defaultCtx` when per-context
  `gpuCtxOps()` returns nil now log `slog.Warn`. Prevents silent shape leaking in
  multi-context scenarios (RepaintBoundary). One-time warning per context.

- **Compute mode test assumptions** — `TestSDFAccelerator_ComputeMode_DelegatesToVello`
  and `TestSDFAccelerator_FillShape_ComputeMode` incorrectly assumed `CanCompute()=false`
  when `NewRenderContext()` initializes the GPU (including Vello dispatcher). Fixed to
  verify commands are queued regardless of compute availability.

## [0.42.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **DrawGPUTexture invisible** (BUG-GPU-TEXTURE-DEEPCOPY-001) — `GPUTextureCommands` were
  not deep-copied in `Flush()` scissor group snapshot. After clearing pending state, the
  owned groups referenced zeroed slice data — GPU texture quads silently dropped every frame.

- **GPU text fallback in offscreen contexts** — `ensureGPU()` was only called in `Flush()`,
  but `DrawText`/`FillShape` checked `gpuReady` before Flush → `ErrFallbackToCPU` → CPU
  bitmap text. Fix: lazy GPU init in `NewRenderContext()` + defense-in-depth in draw methods.
  Glyph mask atlas now propagated to offscreen sessions.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **GPU-to-GPU texture compositing** (`DrawGPUTexture`, Tier 3b) — composite pre-existing
  GPU texture views as textured quads without CPU readback. Follows Skia's
  `GrSurfaceProxyView` direct-bind pattern. Uses `gpucontext.TextureView` (type-safe,
  not `any`). Separate `GPUTextureDrawCommand` struct (Go-idiomatic single responsibility).
  Same pipeline/shader as CPU images — zero new GPU objects.

- **Offscreen GPU texture API** (`CreateOffscreenTexture`) — allocate GPU textures for
  offscreen rendering. Returns `(gpucontext.TextureView, release func())`. Texture usable
  with both `FlushGPUWithView` (render into) and `DrawGPUTexture` (composite from).
  Completes Flutter-pattern GPU layer caching for ui RepaintBoundary.

- **Shared text atlas across GPU contexts** — atlas GPU textures moved from per-session
  to GPUShared (Skia GrAtlasManager pattern). Offscreen contexts see atlas without
  re-upload. Fixes invisible text in offscreen GPU rendering.

### Fixed

- **MinBindingSize validation** (BUG-GPU-MINBINDING-001) — all 7 bind group layouts now
  specify correct MinBindingSize (was 0, rejected by wgpu VAL-006 validation). Fixes
  "encoder in Error state" → black screen.

- **Bullet-proof encoder lifecycle** (BUG-GG-ENCODER-LIFECYCLE-001) — `defer
  encoder.DiscardEncoding()` on all 4 encode paths. Encoder never leaks state regardless
  of error. Submit errors properly free command buffers. Panic-safe.

- **No silently swallowed errors** — all `_ = rp.End()` (4), `_ = rc.Flush()` (6), and
  `_ = s.device.WaitIdle()` (1) replaced with proper error logging.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.25.4 → v0.25.7, gogpu v0.27.3 → v0.28.3, naga v0.17.4 → v0.17.5

## [0.41.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Text outline kerning** (BUG-TEXT-002, BUG-SCENE-TEXT-001) — `drawStringAsOutlines()` now
  uses `text.Shape()` for glyph positioning instead of `face.Glyphs()`. Kerning pairs (Te, AV, Wo)
  work correctly in TextModeVector, rotated, and scaled text.

- **Scene text artifact dots** (BUG-SCENE-TEXT-002) — `outlineToPath()` now skips degenerate
  contours (consecutive MoveTo without drawing ops) that produced stray dots on T/2 glyphs.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.25.3 → v0.25.4, naga v0.17.4 → v0.17.5

## [0.41.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **GPU ImageCache stale texture** (BUG-GPU-IMAGECACHE-001, ADR-014) — replaced pointer-based
  cache key (`&data[0]`) with monotonic `Pixmap.GenerationID()` (process-global `atomic.Uint64`).
  Prevents stale GPU texture reuse when Go GC reuses freed memory addresses. Follows Skia's
  `SkPixelRef::getGenerationID()` pattern, validated by 4 enterprise frameworks.
  - `Pixmap`: new `GenerationID()`, `NotifyPixelsChanged()` methods
  - `ImageBuf`: new `GenerationID()` method
  - `ImageCache`: keyed by `uint64` genID, `unsafe` import removed

- **GPU DrawImage ignores clip** (BUG-GPU-DRAWIMAGE-CLIP-001) — `tryGPUDrawImage()` was missing
  `setGPUClipRect()` call. Textured quads from DrawImage now respect scissor/clip boundaries
  (ScrollView, ClipRect). One-line fix matching all other GPU operations.

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.25.2 → v0.25.3

## [0.41.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Per-context GPU accelerator** (ARCH-GG-001, ADR-013) — split SDFAccelerator
  singleton into GPUShared (global) + GPURenderContext (per gg.Context). Follows
  the Skia GrContext + OpsTask pattern validated by 4 enterprise frameworks
  (Skia, Vello, Qt Quick, Flutter Impeller). Each gg.Context now has its own
  pending command queue, clip state, and frame tracking — no cross-context
  contamination. Enables offscreen GPU rendering for ui RepaintBoundary and
  gogpu multi-window (ADR-010).
  - `GPUShared`: device, queue, pipelines, text/glyph atlas engines (shared)
  - `GPURenderContext`: pending shapes/text/stencil, scissor timeline, LoadOp tracking (per-context)
  - `TexturePool`: Flutter RenderTargetCache pattern, configurable budget (default 128MB)
  - `GPUSceneRenderer`: scene.Renderer GPU path for retained-mode rendering
  - Zero-alloc hot path: QueueShape 26ns/0allocs, ScissorSegment 13ns/0allocs
  - `SurfaceTargetAware` and `SetAcceleratorSurfaceTarget` removed (View in GPURenderTarget)
  - Zero public API breaks (RegisterAccelerator, Accelerator() unchanged)

- **GPU textured quad pipeline** (Tier 3, TASK-GG-GPU-DRAWIMAGE-001) — GPU-accelerated
  DrawImage rendering. Eliminates mid-frame CPU flushes that corrupted GPU-direct
  surface rendering when compositing cached RepaintBoundary images.
  - WGSL shader: vertex ortho projection + fragment texture sampling with opacity
  - ImageCache: LRU 64-entry, identity-keyed by pixel data pointer
  - Axis-aligned transforms only (rotation/skew falls back to CPU)
  - Unblocks ui RepaintBoundary GPU compositing (zero mid-frame readback)

### Fixed

- **Skia AAA pixel-perfect coverage** — three root causes fixed to achieve diff=0
  vs Skia's `aaa_walk_edges` walker (Chrome/Android/Flutter rasterizer):
  1. `trapezoid_to_alpha`: use `area>>8` (Skia source line 535), not `(255*area+32768)>>16`
  2. yShift bit-flag subdivision: 0.75 pixel (bits 14+15) split into 0.25+0.5 sub-strips (line 1466)
  3. Deferred edge insertion: edges inserted between sub-strips at UpperY, not at row start (line 1600)
  Verified via C++ tool built from verbatim Skia source code. Coverage diff=0 for star,
  float rect, and polygon (including near-horizontal edges, BUG-RAST-011).

- **Near-horizontal edge coverage bleed** (BUG-RAST-011, [#235](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/235)) —
  edges with pixel-space UpperY mid-row were not inserted into AET until the next
  pixel row. Fix: insert by pixel-space UpperY + deferred mid-row insertion.
  Polygon coverage: 133 diff → 0 diff.

### Added

- **Convex fast path** (RAST-012) — port of Skia's `aaa_walk_convex_edges`
  (SkScan_AAAPath.cpp:1038-1305). Optimized walker for convex shapes (rect, circle,
  triangle, regular polygons):
  - Paired left/right edges (no AET, no winding walk)
  - kSnapDigit X snapping (1/16 pixel, reduces tiny triangles)
  - Smooth jump (skip fractional Y for smooth edges)
  - Rect fast path (vertical edges, direct blitAntiRect)
  - Zero allocations, 1.6x faster than general walker on benchmarks

- **Two-level test architecture** — Level 1 coverage tests (byte-for-byte vs C++
  Skia-exact, strict diff=0) and Level 2 compositing tests (RGB image comparison).
  22 new tests including 9 regression guards with exact pixel values from C++ ground truth.

- **Scene TagImage rendering** (BUG-SCENE-006) — `scene.Renderer` now renders
  images added via `scene.DrawImage()`. Previously the renderer skipped `TagImage`
  commands with a stub, producing invisible output. Implementation uses inverse
  affine mapping (Cairo/Skia pattern) with premultiplied alpha source-over
  compositing. Supports all affine transforms (translation, scale, rotation, shear).
  Unblocks UI incremental rendering (ADR-004) where text is rendered through
  temp `gg.Context` → captured as `scene.Image`.

### Added

- **Partial texture upload** (PERF-GG-001) — `ggcanvas.Canvas` now supports
  uploading only the changed region of the pixmap to the GPU instead of the full
  texture. New `MarkDirtyRegion(r image.Rectangle)` method accumulates dirty
  regions. When the underlying texture supports sub-region upload (e.g.,
  `gogpu.Texture.UpdateRegion`), only the dirty sub-rectangle is uploaded.
  For 1080p@2x displays, this reduces upload from ~33MB to only the changed area.
  Falls back to full upload when no dirty region is set or the texture does not
  support partial updates.

### Changed

- **GPU render target: per-pass routing** (TASK-GG-OFFSCREEN-001) — `GPURenderTarget.View` (`gpucontext.TextureView`) enables per-render-pass target selection per WebGPU spec. Eliminates session-level `surfaceView` override that forced all rendering to surface. Enables multi-context GPU rendering (RepaintBoundary, offscreen export, multi-window).
- **`SurfaceTargetAware` deprecated** — surface view now travels in `GPURenderTarget.View`, not as side-band session state.
- **`Context.FlushGPUWithView()`** — new method for GPU-direct rendering to a specific texture view.
- **Dependencies:** gpucontext v0.12.0 → v0.14.0 (TextureView type token), gputypes v0.4.0 → v0.5.0 (PrimitiveState zero value)

## [0.40.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Adreno Vulkan miscompilation** ([#252](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/252)) —
  Vello `fine.wgsl` compute shader caused invisible text on Snapdragon X Elite
  (Adreno X1-85). Root cause: Adreno LLVM uses uncached `ldib` reads when shader
  reads/writes same buffer (per Raph Levien's analysis). Two fixes:
  - Packed blend stack: `array<vec4<f32>, 4>` (64B) → packed `u32` + separate
    `blend_spill` SSBO (separates read/write buffers — the real Adreno fix)
  - Thread model: `workgroup_size(256,1,1)` → `workgroup_size(4,16,1)` with
    `PIXELS_PER_THREAD=4` (amortizes PTCL reads, matches Vello). See ADR-011.
  CPU==GPU pixel-perfect match verified (0/120000 diff). 12-13% GPU on Intel (no regression).
- **Removed gogpu dependency** from gg go.mod — gg is fully independent of gogpu.
  Was incorrectly pulled in by temp files.

### Changed

- **Internal: Vello compute clip pipeline** — `SceneElement` API with
  `BeginClip`/`EndClip` for scene encoding. Full clip pipeline matching Vello
  architecture (clip_leaf, per-tile clipZeroDepth). See ADR-012.
  Clip demo examples: `examples/compute_clip/` (CLI) and `examples/clip_demo/`
  (windowed animated, 60 FPS).
- **Internal: Queue.ReadBuffer → Buffer.Map API** migration.
- **deps:** wgpu v0.24.4 → v0.25.1, gpucontext v0.11.0 → v0.12.0,
  naga v0.17.0 → v0.17.4, x/image v0.38.0 → v0.39.0, x/text v0.35.0 → v0.36.0

## [0.40.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Alpha mask API** — complete enterprise-level masking system following Vello/tiny-skia patterns.
  Fixes #238 (SetMask ignored during Fill) and #236 (AsMask documentation). (@Rider21)

  **Per-shape masking** (`SetMask`/`ClearMask`):
  - `SetMask(mask)` modulates each Fill/Stroke individually — mask value (0-255) multiplies pixel coverage
  - Mask and clip compose multiplicatively when both active
  - Saved/restored with Push/Pop

  **Per-layer masking** (`PushMaskLayer`/`PopLayer`):
  - `PushMaskLayer(mask)` creates isolated layer; all drawing goes to layer unmasked
  - `PopLayer()` applies mask to entire layer before compositing back
  - Nested layers compose correctly; `PushMaskLayer(nil)` = regular `PushLayer`

  **Post-processing** (`ApplyMask`):
  - `ApplyMask(mask)` applies DestinationIn blend to already-drawn content
  - All premultiplied channels scaled by mask value

  **Mask constructors:**
  - `NewLuminanceMask(img)` — CSS Masking Level 1 formula (Y = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B)
  - `NewMaskFromData(data, w, h)` — raw byte constructor with copy semantics

  **GPU integration:**
  - `MaskAware` interface for GPU accelerators to support mask textures
  - GPU path uploads mask as R8Unorm texture when accelerator supports it
  - Falls back to CPU when accelerator does not implement `MaskAware`

### Improved

- **AsMask documentation** — clarified that it works with the current unfilled path,
  added three correct usage patterns and documented the common mistake of calling
  AsMask after Fill (which clears the path)

## [0.39.4] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.24.3 → v0.24.4 (software backend enterprise Present via GDI,
  core routing for software surface, adapter logging), gogpu v0.26.3 → v0.26.4

## [0.39.3] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **MSDF text overlapping on Retina** — Large text (28px+) had overlapping letters and
  rectangular artifacts on HiDPI displays (scale=2). MSDF quad positioning used
  `fontSize / refSize` which included deviceScale, producing physical-pixel positions
  in a logical coordinate system. Fixed to `logicalSize / refSize` — CTM handles
  device scaling. Small text (<48px device) was unaffected (uses Glyph Mask pipeline).
  (#247, reported by @jdbann)

## [0.39.2] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **`ParseHex()`** — hex color parsing with error handling. Returns `(RGBA, error)` for invalid input. Existing `Hex()` unchanged (returns black opaque on error). Validates hex characters, supports `#RGB`, `#RGBA`, `#RRGGBB`, `#RRGGBBAA`. (PR #237 by @adamsanclemente)

## [0.39.1] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** wgpu v0.23.9 → v0.24.2 (Metal texture flicker fix, DX12 encoder pool,
  HEAP_TYPE_CUSTOM, unified encoder lifecycle, Metal SetBindGroup slot fix),
  naga v0.16.6 → v0.17.0 (DXIL backend)

## [0.39.0] - 2026-04-05

### Breaking Changes

- **Path API: SOA representation** — `PathElement` interface and struct types
  (`MoveToEl`, `LineToEl`, `QuadToEl`, `CubicToEl`, `CloseEl`) deleted.
  `Elements()` method removed. Use `Iterate()`, `Verbs()`, `Coords()` instead.
  Verb constants renamed: `VerbMoveTo` → `MoveTo`, `VerbLineTo` → `LineTo`, etc.
  This eliminates per-verb heap allocations (Go interface boxing), matching the
  enterprise standard (Skia, tiny-skia, Blend2D, Cairo). See ADR-010.

  **Migration guide:**
  ```go
  // BEFORE (v0.38.x):
  for _, elem := range path.Elements() {
      switch e := elem.(type) {
      case gg.MoveTo:  doMove(e.Point.X, e.Point.Y)
      case gg.LineTo:  doLine(e.Point.X, e.Point.Y)
      }
  }

  // AFTER (v0.39.0):
  path.Iterate(func(verb gg.PathVerb, coords []float64) {
      switch verb {
      case gg.MoveTo:  doMove(coords[0], coords[1])
      case gg.LineTo:  doLine(coords[0], coords[1])
      }
  })
  ```

### Performance

- **Zero-alloc rasterizer pipeline** — FillRect/FillCircle: 14-270 allocs → **0 allocs**.
  EdgeBuilder accepts float64 directly (no float32 conversion alloc), embedded
  clipRect (no pointer escape), embedded sort buffer (no per-call alloc).
- **Embedded stack buffer for Path** — small paths (≤32 verbs) use stack memory.
  ParseSVGPath: 3 → 1 alloc. Path construction: 2 → 0 allocs.
- **Path SOA representation — zero per-verb allocations** (ADR-010) — replaced
  `[]PathElement` (Go interface, heap alloc per verb) with `[]PathVerb` + `[]float64`
  (Skia/tiny-skia/Blend2D pattern). Eliminated all interface boxing. Renamed
  `VerbMoveTo` → `MoveTo`, deleted deprecated `PathElement` types. SVG parser:
  14 → 3 allocs. All consumers migrated to `Iterate()` zero-alloc API.
- **Gradient rendering 2–5x faster, zero allocations** — `sortStops()` was called
  per-pixel (copying + sorting on every `ColorAt()`). Now pre-sorted at
  `AddColorStop()` time with lazy cache invalidation.
  LinearGradient: 181ns/4allocs → 33ns/0allocs (5.5x).
  RadialGradient: 253ns/4allocs → 105ns/0allocs (2.4x).
- **Circle/curve rendering 90–95% fewer allocations** — `NewLineEdge()` returns
  value type instead of heap pointer. FillCircle r500: 270 → 14 allocs.
- **Scene renderer 40% fewer allocs, 71% less memory** — pooled Paths, Paints,
  Decoders, clip masks per tile. 4K render: 4M → 2.4M allocs, 238MB → 68MB.
- **Scene build 75% fewer allocs** — `PathBuilder` interface + path pool.
  10K shapes: 40K → 10K allocs.
- **Worker pool 50% fewer allocs** — `ExecuteIndexed()` eliminates per-tile
  closure + work slice allocations. 4K clear: 4083 → 2043 allocs.
- **Stroke expansion 2–13x faster, up to 98% less memory** — embedded path
  builders, reusable flatten buffer. SimpleLine: 13x faster, 98% less memory.

### Fixed

- **Removed 3 dead naga SPIR-V workarounds** in Vello compute shaders — naga v0.16.6
  fixed the codegen bugs. All three verified with GPU golden comparison (CPU vs GPU
  pixel-perfect match) on Vulkan, DX12, and GLES:
  - `backdrop.wgsl`: flat loop → nested for-loops (Rust Vello pattern)
  - `fine.wgsl`: `select()` → `if/else` for y_edge contribution
  - `path_tiling.wgsl`: let-chain + `select()` → `var` + `if/else` clipping
- **Standalone compute adapter selection** — `RequestAdapter(nil)` instead of
  `HighPerformance` which rejected IntegratedGPU (Intel Iris Xe).
- **dashQuad/dashCubic off-by-one** — flattened curve points loop started at
  index 1 instead of 2, mixing up x/y coordinates for dashed curves.

### Changed

- **deps: wgpu v0.23.0 → v0.23.9** — adapter limits, PowerPreference fallback,
  GLES binding counters, StagingBelt alignment, GLES scissor/blit fix (#226)
- **deps: naga v0.15.0 → v0.16.6** — +45 SPIR-V fixes, full Rust parity, GLSL backend fixes
- **deps: gputypes v0.3.0 → v0.4.0**
- **deps: golang.org/x/image v0.37.0 → v0.38.0**

## [0.38.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- **`Clear()` documentation and examples** — Godoc now correctly states that `Clear()`
  resets to transparent; `ClearWithColor()` is the recommended way to set a background
  color (Blend2D/Skia/HTML Canvas pattern). Updated all examples that used
  `dc.SetRGB(...); dc.Clear()` to use `dc.ClearWithColor(gg.RGB(...))`.
  Fixes [#227](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/227).
- **`Recorder.Clear()` semantics** — `Recorder.Clear()` now matches `Context.Clear()`
  by clearing to transparent. Previously it used the current fill brush, which was
  inconsistent with `Context.Clear()` behavior.
- **Render() promotes pendingTexture** — Universal rendering path (CPU pixmap →
  GPU texture → present) now correctly promotes pending texture via TextureCreator
  duck-typing. Fixes black screen on CPU-only adapters. (BUG-GOGPU-001)
- **Skip GPU-direct path on CPU adapters** — `AcceleratorCanRenderDirect()` returns
  false on llvmpipe/SwiftShader, forcing universal path. Prevents empty SDF render
  on GPU-disabled accelerator.

### Changed

- **GPU accelerator: wgpu Submit API update** — Updated internal GPU code
  (SDF renderer, Vello accelerator, stencil renderer, render session) to use
  new wgpu `Queue.Submit()` signature (returns submission index, non-blocking).
  Replaces `SubmitWithFence` + `WaitForFence` with `Submit` + `WaitIdle`.
  Part of enterprise fence architecture fix (wgpu BUG-GOGPU-004).
- **deps: wgpu v0.22.1 → v0.23.0** — Enterprise fence architecture
- **deps: naga v0.14.8 → v0.15.0** — Full Rust parity (all 5 backends 100%)
- **deps: goffi v0.4.2 → v0.5.0** — Windows ARM64 support

## [0.38.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **DrawImage with rotation/skew** — `ImagePattern` now uses pre-computed inverse
  affine matrix for device-to-image coordinate mapping (Cairo/Skia/tiny-skia pattern).
  Previously used simple anchor+offset which only worked for axis-aligned transforms.
  Fixes [#224](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/224).

## [0.38.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Enterprise SVG renderer** (`gg/svg` package) — full SVG XML parser and renderer
  for JetBrains-quality icon rendering. Supports all JB icon elements: `<path>`,
  `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<g>`, `<polygon>`, `<polyline>`, `<line>`, `<ellipse>`.
  Fill/stroke with evenodd, opacity, transforms (translate/rotate/scale/matrix),
  ViewBox scaling, color override for theming (`RenderWithColor`). 2054 LOC, 64 tests
  with 7 real JetBrains SVG icons embedded.

- **SVG path data parser** — `ParseSVGPath(d string)` parses SVG `d` attribute into
  `*Path`. All commands: M/m, L/l, H/h, V/v, C/c, S/s, Q/q, T/t, A/a, Z/z.
  Arc-to-cubic conversion per W3C SVG spec F.6.5. 56 tests.

- **Transform-aware path rendering** — `DrawPath(path)` replays parsed path through
  current CTM (Translate/Scale/Rotate). `FillPath(path)` and `StrokePath(path)` for
  one-call rendering. Fixes SVG icons invisible when rendered with Push/Translate/Scale.

- **`SetPath`/`AppendPath` + `Path.Append`** — set or append pre-built paths
  (e.g., from `ParseSVGPath`) to the current context path.

- **ClearType LCD subpixel text rendering pipeline** — dual GPU pipeline (Skia pattern)
  for LCD subpixel text. CPU rasterizes glyphs at 3x horizontal oversampling with LCD
  FIR filter, GPU composites per-channel alpha via dedicated `glyph_mask_lcd.wgsl` shader.
  Separate LCD pipeline avoids Intel Vulkan uniform struct bug. Public API:
  `dc.SetLCDLayout(gg.LCDLayoutRGB)` / `LCDLayoutBGR` / `LCDLayoutNone`.

- **LCD ClearType text example** (`examples/lcd_text/`) — windowed demo with
  GPU Tier 6 LCD pipeline via ggcanvas.

### Fixed

- **`BeginAcceleratorFrame` moved from `RenderDirect` to `Draw`** — prevents
  mid-frame CPU fallback content from being wiped by a second `LoadOpClear`.
  Fixes first-frame rendering issues in event-driven mode (RENDER-DIRECT-003).

- **Glyph mask atlas sync diagnostic** — warning log when text is silently
  skipped due to unsynchronized atlas page (`PageTextureView` returns nil).

- **Nearest filtering for glyph mask bitmap atlas** — fixes blurry text
  when atlas uses linear interpolation.

### Changed

- **Extracted GPU pipeline helpers** — `stencilPassthroughDepthStencil()`,
  `triangleListPrimitive()`, `defaultMultisample()` eliminate duplicate pipeline
  descriptor boilerplate across 6 GPU tiers.

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.21.3 → v0.22.1
- gpucontext v0.10.0 → v0.11.0

## [0.37.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **Separate device scale from user CTM (Cairo/Skia/Blend2D pattern)** — `c.matrix`
  now contains only user transforms (starts as `Identity()`). Device scale is stored
  in a separate `deviceMatrix` field and applied at rendering boundaries via
  `totalMatrix()`. Paths are stored in user-space. This fixes:
  - `GetCurrentPoint()` returning device-space coordinates instead of user-space
    with `DeviceScale > 1.0` ([#218](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/218))
  - `Identity()` resetting to `Scale(2,2)` instead of pure identity on HiDPI
  - `GetTransform()` exposing device scale in the returned matrix
  - Clip stack bounds/path coordinate space mismatch on Retina displays
  - `glyphMaskDeviceSize()` double-counting device scale through `c.matrix.E`
  - Zero behavioral change at `DeviceScale=1.0` (common case, zero overhead)

### Testing

- **Test coverage 77.4% → 81.5%** — enterprise-grade test suite for awesome-go submission.
  Key improvements: `internal/path` 27%→98%, `internal/clip` 71%→83%, `surface` 61%→85%,
  `recording/backends/raster` 55%→81%, `recording` 82%→91%, `scene` 77%→82%,
  `text/emoji` 44%→53%, root `gg` package 87%→92%.
  Tests focus on coordinate space consistency, round-trip correctness, edge cases,
  and regression guards — not coverage padding.

### Discovered

- **`dashQuad`/`dashCubic` off-by-one iteration bug** (`software.go:887`) — flattened
  points array uses x,y pairs starting from index 0, but the loop started at index 1
  with step 2, reading misaligned coordinates. Can cause index-out-of-bounds panic.

## [0.37.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **`ggcanvas.Render(dc RenderTarget)`** — Universal one-call canvas presentation.
  Tries GPU-direct first, falls back to CPU pixmap → texture → present.
  Works on all backends including software.

- **SDFAccelerator CPU adapter detection** — Detects `DeviceType == CPU`,
  disables GPU pipelines, enables automatic CPU rasterizer fallback.

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.21.2 → v0.21.3 (GLES/DX12/software fixes, naga v0.14.8)

## [0.37.2] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **GPU pipelines: force recreation when clip layout changes** — All 5 GPU pipelines
  (SDF, convex, text, glyph mask, stencil cover) now track whether their pipeline layout
  was created with the clip bind group layout. When `SetClipBindLayout()` is called after
  pipeline creation, pipelines are destroyed and recreated with the correct layout.
  Fixes Vulkan crash on AMD/NVIDIA GPUs (`vkCmdBindDescriptorSets` with out-of-range
  `firstSet`). Intel silently tolerated the spec violation.
  Fixes [ui#52](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/52).

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.21.1 → v0.21.2 (core validation: Binder, SetBindGroup bounds, draw-time
  compatibility — prevents crash before it reaches Vulkan driver)

## [0.37.1] - 2026-03-15

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.21.0 → v0.21.1 (per-stage resource limit validation)

## [0.37.0] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **GPU internals: migrated from hal types to wgpu public API** — All stencil state
  types (`StencilFaceState`, `StencilOperation` constants), texture barrier types
  (`TextureBarrier`, `TextureUsageTransition`), and copy types (`BufferTextureCopy`,
  `ImageCopyTexture`) now use `wgpu.*` instead of `wgpu/hal.*`. Zero `hal` imports
  remain in production GPU code (7 files changed).

- **GPU standalone init: uses wgpu public API** — `SDFAccelerator` and
  `VelloAccelerator` standalone GPU initialization now uses `wgpu.CreateInstance()` →
  `RequestAdapter()` → `RequestDevice()` instead of direct `hal.GetBackend()` access.
  The `halInstance hal.Instance` field replaced with `instance *wgpu.Instance`.

- **Logger propagation through wgpu API** — `setLogger()` now calls
  `wgpu.SetLogger()` instead of `hal.SetLogger()`, maintaining full stack logging
  (gg → wgpu → core → hal → GPU backends) without importing `wgpu/hal`.

### Fixed

- **macOS Metal: explicit SetViewport in all GPU render passes** — All 4 render pass
  entry points (readback, surface, readback-grouped, surface-grouped) now call
  `SetViewport(0, 0, w, h, 0, 1)` after `BeginRenderPass`. Previously relied on Metal's
  default viewport which caused content offset on macOS — shapes appeared in the
  lower-right corner or as a small bright spot. Defense-in-depth pattern matching Gio
  and wgpu-rs. Fixes [gg#171](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/171),
  [ui#48](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/48),
  [ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23).

- **`encodeSubmitSurface` now uses width/height parameters** — Previously discarded
  `w, h` arguments (`_, _ uint32`). Now uses them for SetViewport.

### Changed

- **Updated naga v0.14.6 → v0.14.7** — Fixes Metal `buffer(0)` conflict when
  `ClipParams` and `Uniforms` both mapped to `[[buffer(0)]]` in MSL output.

- **Typed `DeviceProviderAware.SetDeviceProvider`** — Takes `gpucontext.DeviceProvider`
  instead of `any`. Zero `any` in the accelerator provider chain.

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.20.2 → v0.21.0 (three-layer public API, proper type definitions)
- gpucontext v0.9.0 → v0.10.0 (typed interfaces, HalProvider removed)

## [0.36.4] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **GPU RRect clip via analytic SDF in fragment shaders (GPU-CLIP-002)** — rounded
  rectangle clipping now works on GPU. A two-level clip strategy combines the
  free hardware scissor rect (bounding box) with a per-pixel SDF evaluation in
  fragment shaders for anti-aliased rounded corners. Covers ~95% of non-rectangular
  UI clipping (card views, dialogs, scroll containers with rounded corners).
  - `ClipRoundRect(x, y, w, h, radius)` on Context — sets a rounded rectangle
    clip region with automatic coordinate/radius transform
  - `RRectClipAware` accelerator interface (`SetClipRRect`/`ClearClipRRect`)
  - `ClipParams` uniform struct (32 bytes) shared across all 5 GPU pipelines
    at `@group(1) @binding(0)` — pooled per-frame with reuse
  - Branchless SDF clip in shape shaders (sdf_render, convex, cover): 11 sqrt
    calls, naga-safe (no abs/min/max/clamp/smoothstep builtins), arithmetic
    select via `clip_enabled * sdf + (1 - clip_enabled)` for Intel Vulkan
  - Text shaders (msdf_text, glyph_mask) return 1.0 for clip coverage —
    Intel Vulkan generates corrupt code when SDF + textureSample combined
    (text clipping via hardware scissor rect only, stencil planned GPU-CLIP-003)
  - `ClipStack.PushRRect()`, `IsRRectOnly()`, `RRectBounds()` — rounded
    rectangle entries in the clip stack with SDF coverage for CPU path
  - `ScissorGroup.ClipRRect` — per-group clip propagation in grouped render
  - `ClipRoundRect` command in recording system for vector export backends
  - Clipping example (`examples/clipping/`) updated with rounded rectangle demo

## [0.36.3] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **GPU scissor clipping lost by BeginFrame** — `SDFAccelerator.BeginFrame()`
  cleared `scissorSegments` accumulated during the draw phase. Since
  `RenderDirect()` calls `BeginAcceleratorFrame()` right before `FlushGPU()`,
  all scissor data was destroyed before rendering. Segments are now only cleared
  by `flushLocked()` after consumption.

## [0.36.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **GPU scissor rect performance regression** — v0.36.1 scissor clipping created
  multiple render passes per frame (one per scissor change), causing GPU utilization
  to spike from ~3% to ~45% during scrolling. Replaced batch-breaking approach with
  `ScissorGroup` timeline tracking — all draws accumulate within a single render
  pass, scissor rect is changed per group via `SetScissorRect()` (WebGPU dynamic
  state, zero cost). GPU utilization back to ~3%.
  - `ScissorGroup` type in `GPURenderSession` for per-group scissor tracking
  - `RenderFrameGrouped` render path (single render pass, multiple scissor groups)
  - Removed `flushOnScissorChange` — no more extra render passes

## [0.36.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **GPU pipeline ignoring ClipRect** — `ClipRect` had no effect on GPU-rendered
  content (shapes, text). The GPU render pipeline now uses hardware scissor rect
  (`hal.RenderPassEncoder.SetScissorRect()`) for zero-cost clipping across all 6
  render tiers. Pending draw batches are flushed on scissor change to ensure
  correct per-batch clipping (Skia pattern).
  - `ClipAware` accelerator interface for scissor rect propagation
  - Batch-breaking on scissor change in `SDFAccelerator`
  - Scissor applied in both offscreen and surface render paths
  - Covers ~95% of real-world UI clipping (scroll views, panels, list items)

## [0.36.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **GPU Glyph Mask Cache (Tier 6)** — enterprise text rendering pipeline following
  the Skia/Chrome/DirectWrite pattern: CPU rasterizes glyphs at exact pixel sizes via
  AnalyticFiller (256-level AA coverage), packs into R8 alpha atlas with shelf allocator
  and LRU eviction, uploads to GPU as R8Unorm textures, composites via textured quads
  in the render pass. Foundation for ClearType LCD rendering and font hinting (both included in this release).
  - `text/glyph_mask_atlas.go` — R8 atlas with shelf packing, LRU cache, dirty page tracking
  - `text/glyph_mask_rasterizer.go` — CPU glyph rasterization at exact device pixel size
  - `internal/gpu/glyph_mask_engine.go` — bridge between text shaping and GPU atlas
  - `internal/gpu/glyph_mask_pipeline.go` — Tier 6 GPU render pipeline
  - `internal/gpu/shaders/glyph_mask.wgsl` — R8 atlas sampling shader
  - Subpixel positioning (1/4 pixel, 16 variants per glyph)
  - `TextModeGlyphMask` text mode + auto-selection: horizontal text ≤48px → GlyphMask,
    else MSDF (Tier 4)
  - `GPUGlyphMaskAccelerator` interface in `accelerator.go`
- **`RoundRectShape` with SDF tile rendering** — dedicated rounded rectangle shape for
  the scene package with per-pixel SDF (Signed Distance Field) rendering in the tile
  renderer, bypassing the expensive path pipeline. ~5x faster than `RoundedRectShape`
  (89ns vs 452ns, zero allocations). Supports independent X/Y corner radii.
  - `scene.NewRoundRectShape(rect, rx, ry)` / `scene.NewRoundRectShapeUniform(rect, r)`
  - `TagFillRoundRect` encoding tag with dedicated encoder/decoder
  - `SceneBuilder.FillRoundRect()` convenience method
  - SDF-based `Contains()` for hit testing
- **Scene clip support (BeginClip/EndClip)** — implemented clip regions in the tile
  renderer using alpha mask compositing (Cairo/Skia pattern). Clip path is rendered to
  R8 coverage mask, content renders to temporary pixmap, EndClip applies mask and
  composites back. Supports nested clips, arbitrary clip shapes, and transforms.
  - `SceneBuilder.Clip(shape, fn)` now fully functional
  - Safety cleanup for unbalanced clip stacks
- **Font hinting integration (TEXT-012)** — lightweight auto-hinting for crisp text
  at small sizes (≤48px). Grid-fits glyph outline coordinates to pixel boundaries
  for sharp horizontal stems (baselines, x-heights, cap-heights) and consistent
  vertical stem widths. Inspired by FreeType's auto-hinter approach.
  - `OutlineExtractor.ExtractOutlineHinted()` with `Hinting` parameter
  - `GlyphMaskRasterizer.RasterizeHinted()` — hinted glyph rasterization
  - Y-coordinate grid-fitting: baseline snap (Y≈0→0), horizontal segment detection
  - X-coordinate stem snapping in `HintingFull` mode
  - Hinted advance widths via `sfnt.GlyphAdvance` with `font.HintingFull`
  - Auto-selection: `HintingFull` for ≤48px axis-aligned text, `HintingNone`
    for rotated/skewed/large text
  - Hinting mode already in glyph cache key (no cache pollution)
- **ClearType LCD subpixel rendering (TEXT-011)** — 3× horizontal oversampling with
  5-tap FIR LCD filter for per-channel RGB alpha, following the FreeType/ClearType
  approach. Triples effective horizontal resolution for crisp text on LCD monitors.
  - `text.LCDFilter` — 5-tap FIR filter with configurable weights (default: FreeType "light")
  - `text.LCDLayout` — RGB/BGR subpixel ordering support
  - `text.LCDMaskResult` — per-channel RGB coverage output
  - `GlyphMaskRasterizer.RasterizeLCD()` / `RasterizeLCDOutline()` — 3× oversampled
    rasterization via AnalyticFiller + row-by-row LCD filter application
  - `GlyphMaskAtlas.PutLCD()` — stores 3×-wide RGB data in R8 atlas
  - `GlyphMaskEngine.SetLCDLayout()` / `SetLCDFilter()` — runtime LCD configuration
  - GPU shader: grayscale alpha mask fragment shader (LCD per-channel blending planned)
  - Auto-selection: LCD enabled for ≤48px axis-aligned text when layout is set
  - `IsLCD` flag in `GlyphMaskRegion` and `GlyphMaskQuad` for pipeline awareness

### Fixed

- **Glyph mask text invisible in GPU windowed rendering (Intel Vulkan)** —
  `vkCreateGraphicsPipelines` returned `VK_SUCCESS` but wrote a null pipeline handle
  on Intel Vulkan drivers. Root cause: the `is_lcd: u32` field in the WGSL uniform
  struct generated SPIR-V that triggered the Intel driver bug. Fix: removed `is_lcd`
  from the shader uniform (now matches MSDF pipeline: `transform + color` only),
  reduced uniform buffer from 96 to 80 bytes. LCD rendering temporarily uses
  grayscale-only path; LCD support to be restored via an Intel-compatible mechanism.
- **Glyph mask rasterizer Y-coordinate inversion** — `GlyphMaskRasterizer` applied an
  unnecessary Y-flip to outline coordinates, but `sfnt.LoadGlyph` already returns Y-down
  (screen convention). Glyphs in the R8 atlas were vertically flipped, causing mirrored
  text appearance.
- **Glyph mask text invisible on first frame** — `buildGlyphMaskResources` incorrectly
  invalidated bind groups when creating vertex/index buffers. Bind groups reference
  (uniform buffer, atlas texture, sampler) — not vertex/index buffers — so the
  invalidation destroyed bind groups that were just configured by `syncGlyphMaskAtlases`,
  causing all glyph mask draw calls to be skipped on the first render.

### Changed

- Updated `gogpu/wgpu` v0.20.1 → v0.20.2 (Vulkan WSI query function validation)
- Updated `go-text/typesetting` v0.3.3 → v0.3.4
- Updated `golang.org/x/image` v0.36.0 → v0.37.0
- Updated `golang.org/x/text` v0.34.0 → v0.35.0

## [0.35.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **MSDF atlas FontID collision when mixing fonts from same family** —
  `computeFontID()` hashed `source.Name()` (family name, e.g., "Go") instead of
  `parsed.FullName()` (e.g., "Go Regular" / "Go Bold"). Fonts within the same family
  that share the same glyph count produced identical FontIDs, causing atlas cache
  collisions: Bold glyphs silently overwrote Regular glyphs (or vice versa), resulting
  in per-glyph weight inconsistency when rendering mixed-font text.

### Added

- Regression test for FontID collision (GoRegular vs GoBold same-family detection)

### Changed

- Update gogpu v0.23.1 → v0.23.2 in examples (Retina contentsScale fix)

## [0.35.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **GPU surface not cleared between frames (progressive drift on Retina)** —
  `GPURenderSession.BeginFrame()` was never called, so `frameRendered` stayed `true`
  after the first frame, causing all subsequent frames to use `LoadOpLoad` instead of
  `LoadOpClear`. Previous frame content persisted and new shapes accumulated on top,
  producing progressive stretching and drift on macOS Retina displays. Fix: add
  `FrameAware` interface and `BeginAcceleratorFrame()`, called from
  `ggcanvas.RenderDirect()`. Also auto-detect new frame via swapchain TextureView
  pointer change in `SetSurfaceTarget`. Mid-frame flushes correctly use `LoadOpLoad`
  to preserve previously drawn content.
  ([#171](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/171))

- **TextModeVector text invisible with GPU SurfaceTarget** —
  `drawStringAsOutlines()` rendered glyph outlines directly to CPU pixmap via
  `renderer.Fill()`, bypassing the GPU pipeline. In zero-copy surface mode
  (`ggcanvas.RenderDirect`), the pixmap was never composited onto the GPU surface.
  Fix: route device-space glyph path through `doFill()` — the same multi-tier pipeline
  used by all shapes (GPU stencil+cover → surface, or CPU fallback → pixmap). Also
  removed unnecessary `flushGPUAccelerator()` call that created a mid-frame render pass
  with `LoadOpClear`, wiping previously drawn content.
  ([#184](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/184))

### Dependencies

- Update wgpu v0.20.0 → v0.20.1 (Metal stencil attachment fix for Retina)

## [0.35.1] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- **scene.TextRenderer uses GlyphCache** — `RenderGlyph`, `RenderGlyphs`, and
  `RenderTextToScene` now use the global `GlyphCache` for outline reuse across frames,
  matching the pattern established in `Context.drawStringAsOutlines()`. Eliminates
  redundant outline extraction when rendering text through the scene pipeline.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **TextMode API** — per-Context text rendering strategy selection with four modes:
  `TextModeAuto` (default), `TextModeMSDF` (GPU atlas), `TextModeVector` (glyph outlines),
  `TextModeBitmap` (CPU bitmap). Set via `SetTextMode()` / query via `TextMode()`.
- **DPI-aware MSDF text pipeline** — `deviceScale` propagated through the GPU MSDF
  pipeline. On HiDPI displays (2× Retina), MSDF `screenPxRange` scales proportionally
  with physical font size, producing crisper anti-aliased text without atlas changes.
- **MSDF stem darkening** — shader-level stem darkening (FreeType/macOS/Pathfinder
  pattern) counteracts gamma-induced thinning at small text sizes. Applied to all three
  MSDF entry points (fill, outline, shadow). Starts at `screenPxRange=2`, fades to zero
  at `screenPxRange≥8` (large text unaffected).
- **GlyphCache integration for vector text** — `drawStringAsOutlines()` now caches
  glyph outlines via `text.GlyphCache.GetOrCreate()`, avoiding repeated `ExtractOutline()`
  calls on every frame. Uses the global shared cache for cross-Context reuse.
- **Text-aware rasterizer routing** — area-based tile rasterizer selection replaces
  per-dimension check. Wide-but-short text paths (400+ elements at 16px height) now
  route to SparseStrips tile rasterizer instead of always using AnalyticFiller.
- **Visual regression tests** — 6 test functions covering text quality across strategies
  (Bitmap/Vector), sizes (12-48px), thin strokes, and GlyphCache integration.

### Changed

- **MSDF `pxRange` tuned from 8.0 to 4.0** — doubles effective `screenPxRange` at
  all font sizes, improving anti-aliasing quality especially at 12-16px body text.
- **MSDF error correction threshold raised from 0.25 to 0.40** — more aggressive
  artifact correction for cleaner glyph edges.
- **MSDF `screenPxRange` minimum clamp raised from 1.0 to 1.5** — prevents AA
  failure on very small characters where the range would collapse below usable threshold.

## [0.34.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **`DrawRoundedRectangle` HiDPI/Retina rendering** — fix coordinate space mismatch
  where rounded rectangles appeared at half size in the wrong position on HiDPI displays.
  The method now uses Context drawing methods (with matrix transform) instead of direct
  Path methods, matching the pattern used by `DrawCircle` and `DrawEllipse`.
  ([#171](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/171))

## [0.34.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **GPU pipeline diagnostic logging** — comprehensive structured `slog` logging
  across the entire GPU rendering dimensional handoff chain. All logs are
  zero-cost when disabled (default `nopHandler`). Enable via `gg.SetLogger()`.
  ([#171](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/171))
  - `NewContext` / `SetDeviceScale` — log logical/physical dimensions and scale
  - `ggcanvas.NewWithScale` — log canvas creation with logical, scale, physical dims
  - `ggcanvas.RenderDirect` — log surface dimensions per frame
  - `SetDeviceProvider` — log shared GPU device type on success
  - `SetSurfaceTarget` — log surface dimensions and mode/size changes
  - `RenderFrame` — log effective viewport dimensions (target vs surface override)
  - `EnsureTextures` — log MSAA/stencil texture creation dimensions
  - `FlushGPU` — log target dimensions on entry
  - `makeSDFRenderUniform` — log viewport uniform dimensions passed to shader
  - `Flush` — log pending shape counts per tier and pipeline mode

### Fixed

- **`ggcanvas.NewWithScale` no longer silently discards `SetAcceleratorDeviceProvider`
  errors** — now logs `Warn` on failure instead of `_ =` discard.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **HiDPI/Retina device scale** — Cairo-pattern `SetDeviceScale()` for
  DPI-transparent drawing. User code draws in logical coordinates (points/DIP),
  the Context automatically scales to physical pixel resolution internally.
  ([#171](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/171),
  [#175](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/175))
  - `NewContextWithScale(w, h, scale)` — create HiDPI-aware context
  - `WithDeviceScale(scale)` — functional option for `NewContext`
  - `SetDeviceScale(scale)` — set device scale on existing context
  - `DeviceScale()` — query current device scale
  - `PixelWidth()/PixelHeight()` — physical pixel dimensions
  - `Width()/Height()` — logical dimensions (unchanged)
- **DPI-aware rasterization tolerances** — curve flattening tolerance and stroke
  expansion tolerance now scale with device DPI (femtovg pattern:
  `tolerance = baseTolerance / deviceScale`). Produces sharper curves on
  Retina/HiDPI displays.
- **ggcanvas HiDPI auto-detection** — `ggcanvas.New()` auto-detects HiDPI scale
  via `gpucontext.WindowProvider` interface (no manual scale parameter needed).
  `ggcanvas.NewWithScale()` and `MustNewWithScale()` for explicit control.
  `DeviceScale()` and `SetDeviceScale()` methods on Canvas.

## [0.33.6] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- **Update wgpu v0.19.7 → v0.20.0** — enterprise-grade validation layer:
  core validation (30+ WebGPU spec rules), 7 typed error types with `errors.As()`,
  WebGPU deferred error pattern, HAL defense-in-depth.
- **Update gputypes v0.2.0 → v0.3.0** — `TextureUsage.ContainsUnknownBits()`.

## [0.33.5] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **Fix stroke join artifacts at acute/near-reversal angles** — implement
  Skia/tiny-skia inner join handling: at acute angles, the outer (convex) side
  receives join decoration (miter/bevel/round) while the inner (concave) side
  routes through the pivot point to prevent self-intersection. Previously both
  sides were treated identically (inherited from kurbo), causing visible
  artifacts. Verified against Skia, tiny-skia, and Vello reference
  implementations.
  ([#168](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/168),
  reported in [#159](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/159) by
  [@rcarlier](https://github.com/rcarlier))

### Changed

- **Per-batch uniform buffers for MSDF text pipeline** — replace single
  uniform buffer/bind group with pooled slices that grow per batch, fixing
  resource lifecycle for multi-batch text rendering.

## [0.33.4] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **Fix `DrawStringAnchored` vertical anchor (`ay`) formula** — the formula
  `y += h * ay` (inherited from fogleman/gg) did not match the documented
  semantics `(0,0)=top-left, (0.5,0.5)=center, (1,1)=bottom-right`. Replaced
  with the correct bounding-box anchor formula `y = y + ascent - ay * h` where
  `h = ascent + descent` (visual bounding box, no lineGap). Research verified
  against Cairo, Skia, and HTML Canvas baseline models.
  ([#166](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/166),
  reported in [#159](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/159) by
  [@rcarlier](https://github.com/rcarlier))

- **Fix `DrawStringWrapped` vertical anchor and height calculation** — same
  formula fix applied. Block height now uses
  `(n-1)*fh*lineSpacing + ascent + descent` (visual bounding box model).

- **Fix `MeasureMultilineString` height calculation** — now returns visual
  bounding box height consistent with `DrawStringWrapped`.

## [0.33.3] - 2026-03-07

### Changed

- **Update wgpu v0.19.6 → v0.19.7** — Queue.WriteTexture public API
  ([wgpu#95](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/pull/95) by [@Carmen-Shannon](https://github.com/Carmen-Shannon))
- **Update naga v0.14.5 → v0.14.6** — MSL pass-through globals fix
  ([naga#40](https://github.com/gogpu/naga/pull/40))

## [0.33.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Logger propagation to wgpu HAL** — `gg.SetLogger()` now propagates to
  `hal.SetLogger()`, enabling Metal/Vulkan backend logging with a single call.
  Previously, HAL-level logs (surface configuration, pipeline creation, command
  submission) were silently discarded even when gg logging was enabled.

### Added

- **RenderFrame debug log** — render session logs shape/text counts and surface
  mode at DEBUG level, making it visible when GPU rendering actually executes.

### Changed

- **Update wgpu v0.19.5 → v0.19.6** — Metal MSAA resolve store action fix
  ([wgpu#94](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/pull/94))

## [0.33.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Fix FDot6→FDot16 integer overflow causing black lines/artifacts** — three-layer fix:
  (1) reduce aaShift from 4 to 2 (Skia default), expanding max coordinate from 2048px to
  8191px; (2) path clipping to canvas bounds in EdgeBuilder with Skia-style sentinel
  vertical lines preserving winding; (3) saturating FDot6ToFDot16 conversion clamping to
  int32 range instead of wrapping. aaShift=4 (16x AA) was unnecessarily aggressive —
  Skia ships aaShift=2 (4x AA) on billions of devices with excellent quality.
  ([#148](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/148))

### Changed

- **Update wgpu v0.19.4 → v0.19.5** — Metal vertex descriptor fix
  ([wgpu#93](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/pull/93))
- **Update naga v0.14.4 → v0.14.5**
- **Update goffi v0.4.1 → v0.4.2**

## [0.33.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **DrawImage respects clip stack** — `DrawImageEx` refactored to route through the
  `Fill()` pipeline (image-as-shader pattern). Images now correctly clip to any path
  set via `Clip()`, `ClipRect()`, or nested `Push`/`Pop` clips. This follows the
  enterprise pattern used by Skia, Cairo, tiny-skia, and Vello.
  ([#155](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/155))
- **`DrawImageRounded(img, x, y, radius)`** — convenience method for drawing images
  with rounded corners
- **`DrawImageCircular(img, cx, cy, radius)`** — convenience method for drawing
  circular avatar-style images
- **`ImagePattern.SetAnchor(x, y)`** — position image patterns at arbitrary canvas
  coordinates instead of tiling from origin (0,0)
- **`ImagePattern.SetScale(sx, sy)`** — scale image patterns
- **`ImagePattern.SetOpacity(opacity)`** — opacity multiplier for image patterns
- **`ImagePattern.SetClamp(bool)`** — clamp mode: out-of-bounds returns transparent
  instead of tiling
- **Fill() and Stroke() respect clip stack** — all software rendering paths (analytic
  filler + coverage filler) now apply clip masks via `Paint.ClipCoverage`
- **Anti-aliased clip masks** — path-based clips now use 4x Y-supersampling with
  fractional X-edge coverage for smooth clip edges (previously binary 0/255 only)

## [0.32.5] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- **Update wgpu v0.19.3 → v0.19.4** — fix SIGSEGV on Linux/macOS for Vulkan
  functions with >6 arguments ([goffi#19](https://github.com/go-webgpu/goffi/issues/19),
  [gogpu#119](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/119))

## [0.32.4] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- **Update wgpu v0.19.0 → v0.19.3** — includes MSL backend fixes for Apple Silicon:
  vertex `[[stage_in]]` for struct-typed arguments, `metal::discard_fragment()` namespace
  ([naga#38](https://github.com/gogpu/naga/pull/38),
  [ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23))

## [0.32.3] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Horizontal line artifacts in rotated text (#148)** — forward differencing in
  `QuadraticEdge`/`CubicEdge` produced zero-height segments after FDot6 rounding,
  silently losing winding contribution. The residual propagated via tail accumulator
  to all pixels rightward, creating horizontal gray lines from curved glyphs (e, o,
  b, p) at small rotation angles. Fix: flatten curves to line segments (adaptive
  subdivision, 0.1px tolerance) before AnalyticFiller scanline processing —
  industry-standard approach (tiny-skia, Skia AAA).
- **Tab character rendering as tofu boxes (TEXT-008)** — tab (`\t`) rendered as
  `.notdef` rectangle across all text paths: bitmap (`font.Drawer`), outline
  (`drawStringAsOutlines`), and HarfBuzz (`GoTextShaper`). Fix: unified tab handling
  at each rendering layer — `expandTabs()` for bitmap path, space GID + tab-stop
  advance for shaper/outline paths. Configurable via `text.SetTabWidth()` (default: 8,
  matching CSS `tab-size`, Pango, and POSIX terminal conventions).
- **Text rasterizer mode propagation** — `drawStringAsOutlines()` bypassed `doFill()`,
  so `SetRasterizerMode()` had no effect on outline-rendered text.

### Added

- **Tab character API** — `text.SetTabWidth(n)` / `text.TabWidth()` for configurable
  tab stops (default: 8, matching CSS `tab-size`, Pango, POSIX).
- **Text regression test suite (TEXT-011)** — programmatic artifact detection for
  rotated text (9 angles, curved glyphs), tab rendering verification (bitmap + outline),
  and unit tests for tab configuration (`expandTabs`, `SetTabWidth`, `tabAdvance`,
  `fixTabGlyphs`). Cross-platform, no golden images.

## [0.32.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **GPU error propagation for `WriteBuffer`** — 15+ call sites across `render_session.go`,
  `sdf_render.go`, `stencil_renderer.go`, `vello_accelerator.go`, `vello_compute.go` now
  check and propagate errors instead of silently swallowing them. Buffer upload failures
  trigger proper cleanup (destroy buffer) before returning errors.
- **GPU error propagation for `WriteTexture`** — `text_pipeline.go` and `sdf_gpu.go` now
  propagate texture upload errors with cleanup on failure.
- **`uploadPathAuxData` returns error** — `VelloAccelerator.uploadPathAuxData` now returns
  `error` instead of silently ignoring buffer upload failures.

### Changed

- Update wgpu v0.18.1 → v0.19.0 — `WriteBuffer` and `WriteTexture` breaking interface changes

## [0.32.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **CPU text transform support (TEXT-002)** — `DrawString` now respects the full CTM
  (Current Transform Matrix) for CPU text rendering, not just position. Three-tier
  hybrid decision tree modeled after Skia/Cairo/Vello:
  - **Tier 0**: Translation-only → bitmap fast path (zero quality loss)
  - **Tier 1**: Uniform positive scale ≤256px → bitmap at device pixel size (Skia pattern)
  - **Tier 2**: Rotation, shear, non-uniform scale, mirror, extreme scale → glyph vector
    outlines converted to `Path`, transformed by CTM, filled via `SoftwareRenderer`
  - `DrawStringAnchored` and `DrawStringWrapped` inherit transform support automatically
  - MultiFace graceful degradation (falls back to position-only bitmap)
  - Lazy `OutlineExtractor` initialization on Context (GC-managed lifecycle)
  ([#145](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/145))
- **GPU MSDF text transform support (TEXT-001)** — CTM passed to GPU MSDF
  vertex shader for correct scale, rotation, and skew of GPU-rendered text.
  ([#146](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/146))
- **Text transform golden tests (TEXT-003)** — 9-scenario golden test suite
  (identity, translate, scale, rotate, shear) with cross-comparison validation.
- **`examples/text_transform`** — Visual 3×3 grid example demonstrating all
  CPU text rendering tiers with per-cell clipping.

### Fixed

- **Outline text Y-coordinate inversion** — `drawStringAsOutlines` used Y-up
  formula but `sfnt.LoadGlyph` returns Y-down (screen convention). Text rendered
  via Tier 2 (rotation, shear, non-uniform scale) was upside-down.
  ([#145](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/145))
- **`scene/text.go` FlipY default** — Changed `TextRendererConfig.FlipY` default
  from `true` to `false`. Since `OutlineExtractor` preserves sfnt's Y-down
  convention, no flip is needed. Fixes inverted text in scene text rendering.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Smart rasterizer selection** — Multi-factor auto-selection of rasterization
  algorithm per-path. Adaptive threshold formula `max(32, 2048/sqrt(bboxArea))`
  considers path complexity and bounding box area. BBox precheck: paths < 32px
  always use scanline. Five algorithms: AnalyticFiller (scanline), SparseStrips
  (4×4 tiles), TileCompute (16×16 tiles), SDFAccelerator (per-pixel SDF),
  Vello PTCL (GPU compute).
- **`CoverageFiller` interface** — Tile-based coverage rasterizer interface with
  `RegisterCoverageFiller()` / `GetCoverageFiller()` registration pattern
  (mirrors `GPUAccelerator`). `ForceableFiller` extension interface exposes
  `SparseFiller()` / `ComputeFiller()` for forced algorithm selection.
- **`AdaptiveFiller`** — Auto-selects between SparseStrips (4×4) and TileCompute
  (16×16) based on estimated segment count (10K threshold) and canvas area (2MP).
- **`RasterizerMode` API** — Per-context force override: `RasterizerAuto`,
  `RasterizerAnalytic`, `RasterizerSparseStrips`, `RasterizerTileCompute`,
  `RasterizerSDF`. Use `Context.SetRasterizerMode()` for debugging, benchmarking,
  or known workloads.
- **`ForceSDFAware` interface** — Optional GPU accelerator interface for forced
  SDF rendering. `SetForceSDF(true)` bypasses the 16px minimum size check.
- **`gg/raster/` package** — CPU-only tile rasterizer registration via blank
  import `import _ "github.com/gogpu/gg/raster"`. Independent of GPU packages.
- **SDF minimum size** — Shapes smaller than 16px skip SDF rendering (unless
  `RasterizerSDF` mode is forced) to avoid overhead on tiny shapes.

## [0.31.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: rounded rectangle pixel corruption** — update wgpu v0.18.0 → v0.18.1 which fixes
  buffer-to-image copy row stride calculation on non-power-of-2 width textures.
  ([gogpu#96](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/discussions/96))

## [0.31.0] - 2026-02-27

### Breaking Changes

- **`text.Shape()` signature changed** — Removed redundant `size float64` parameter. Size is now obtained from `face.Size()`. All callers must update: `Shape(text, face, size)` → `Shape(text, face)`. This affects `Shape`, `LayoutText`, `LayoutTextWithContext`, `LayoutTextSimple`, `WrapText`, `MeasureText`, and the `Shaper` interface. ([#138](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/138))

### Added

- **`DrawStringWrapped()`** — Wraps text to width and draws with alignment and anchoring. Compatible with fogleman/gg's `DrawStringWrapped`. Supports `AlignLeft`, `AlignCenter`, `AlignRight`. ([#138](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/138))
- **`MeasureMultilineString()`** — Measures text containing newlines with configurable line spacing. Compatible with fogleman/gg. ([#138](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/138))
- **`WordWrap()`** — Wraps text at word boundaries, returns `[]string`. Compatible with fogleman/gg. ([#138](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/138))
- **`Align` type + constants** — `gg.AlignLeft`, `gg.AlignCenter`, `gg.AlignRight` re-exported from `text.Alignment` for convenience. ([#138](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/138))
- **`gg.RGBA` implements `color.Color`** — Added `RGBA()` method returning premultiplied uint32 values for stdlib compatibility. ([#138](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/138))
- **`Pixmap.SetPixelPremul()`** — Direct premultiplied RGBA pixel write without alpha conversion overhead. ([#114](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/114))
- **Recording mirror** — `DrawStringWrapped`, `MeasureMultilineString`, `WordWrap` mirrored on `recording.Recorder` for vector export.

### GPU Pipeline

- **Tier 5 scene accumulation (GG-COMPUTE-008)** — `VelloAccelerator` now accumulates `PathDef`s during `FillPath`/`StrokePath` and dispatches via compute pipeline on `Flush`. Path conversion (gg.Path → tilecompute.PathDef) with Euler spiral curve flattening.
- **PipelineMode wiring (GG-COMPUTE-006)** — `Context.SetPipelineMode()` propagates to GPU accelerator. `SDFAccelerator` holds internal `VelloAccelerator` and routes to compute pipeline when `PipelineModeCompute` is active. `SelectPipeline()` heuristics exported.
- **Removed 2 naga workarounds from `path_tiling.wgsl`** — Inline `span()` replaced with function call, `let`-chain replaced with `var` reassignment. Validated by golden tests. 3 workarounds remain due to active naga SPIR-V bugs ([#139](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/139)).

### Fixed

- **`LayoutText` wrapped line Y positions** — Lines all had Y=0 instead of cumulative vertical positions. Each line now has correct Y = previous Y + descent + line gap + current ascent. ([#138](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/138))
- Resolved all golangci-lint issues (errorlint, gocognit, staticcheck, dupl).

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.16.17 → v0.18.0

## [0.30.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- `FontSource.Face()` now panics with clear message instead of cryptic SIGSEGV when called on nil receiver ([#134](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/134))
- `BuiltinShaper` now skips control characters (U+0000..U+001F) instead of rendering them as missing glyph boxes ([#134](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/134))
- `WrapText` now respects hard line breaks (`\n`, `\r\n`, `\r`) — paragraphs are split before wrapping, matching `LayoutText` behavior ([#134](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/134))
- **Vello compute GPU buffer overflow** — `computeBufferSizes` used `numLines * 4` heuristic for segment buffer allocation, which overflowed for scenes with long diagonal lines (e.g., a 3-line triangle needed 23 segment slots but only 12 were allocated). Replaced with DDA upper bound `numLines * (widthInTiles + heightInTiles)` ([#135](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/135))

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.16.15 → v0.16.17 (load platform Vulkan surface creation functions — [gogpu#106](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/106))

## [0.30.1] - 2026-02-25

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.16.14 → v0.16.15 (software backend always compiled, no build tags — [gogpu#106](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/106))

## [0.30.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Vello compute pipeline (Tier 5)** — Port of vello's 9-stage GPU compute
  architecture for full-scene parallel rasterization. 9 WGSL compute shaders
  (pathtag_reduce, pathtag_scan, draw_reduce, draw_leaf, path_count, backdrop,
  coarse, path_tiling, fine) dispatched via wgpu HAL. 16×16 tiles, 256 threads
  per workgroup.
- **tilecompute CPU reference** — Complete CPU implementation of the 9-stage
  pipeline (`RasterizeScenePTCL`) for golden test comparison and CPU fallback.
  Includes scene encoding (`EncodeScene`/`PackScene`), Euler spiral curve
  flattening, path tag/draw monoid prefix scans, per-tile segment counting,
  backdrop accumulation, coarse PTCL generation, path_tiling segment clipping,
  and fine per-pixel rasterization.
- **PipelineMode API** — `PipelineModeAuto`, `PipelineModeRenderPass`,
  `PipelineModeCompute` for selecting between render-pass (Tiers 1–4) and
  compute (Tier 5) GPU pipelines.
- **GPU vs CPU golden tests** — 7 test scenes (triangle, square, circle,
  star nonzero/evenodd, multipath, overlapping semitransparent) comparing
  GPU compute output against CPU reference pixel-by-pixel.

### Fixed

- **DrawString not affected by Transform** ([#129](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/129)) —
  `DrawString` and `DrawStringAnchored` now apply `c.matrix.TransformPoint()` to the text
  position before rendering, consistent with `MoveTo`, `LineTo`, and other drawing methods.
- **DrawImageEx missing scaling transform** ([#130](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/130)) —
  `DrawImageEx` now computes a scaling transform that maps dst rect coordinates to src rect
  coordinates. Without this, images were clipped to source size when the destination was larger.
- **fine.wgsl y_edge** — select() workaround for naga SPIR-V codegen bug
  that caused incorrect edge coverage in fine rasterization stage.
- **coarse.wgsl Z-order** — per-tile iteration instead of per-draw-object
  ensures correct front-to-back ordering in PTCL generation.

### Dependencies

- naga v0.14.2 → v0.14.3 (5 SPIR-V backend bug fixes)
- wgpu v0.16.13 → v0.16.14 (Vulkan null surface handle guard)

## [0.29.5] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **AdvanceX drift causing edge expansion** ([#95](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/95)) —
  scanline-to-scanline AdvanceX() accumulated floating-point error, causing triangle/polygon
  edges to progressively expand toward the bottom of shapes. Replaced with direct per-scanline
  X computation from edge endpoints.
- **coverageToRuns maxValue bug** ([#95](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/95)) —
  when merging adjacent alpha runs, the merged run used the sum of coverage values instead of
  the maximum, causing vertex pixels to receive incorrect partial coverage (darker than expected).
  Added 4 regression tests for vertex pixel accuracy.

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.16.12 → v0.16.13 (VK_EXT_debug_utils fix)
- gogpu v0.20.3 → v0.20.4 (examples/gogpu_integration)

## [0.29.4] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **scene.Renderer: delegate rasterization to gg.SoftwareRenderer** (#124)
  - Replaced broken internal rasterizer with delegation to `gg.SoftwareRenderer`
  - Fill/stroke now rendered with analytic anti-aliasing (Vello tile-based AA)
  - Full curve support in stroke (CubicTo, QuadTo) — circles/ellipses render correctly
  - Premultiplied source-over alpha compositing (replaces raw `copy()`)
  - Background preservation — user's `target.Clear()` is no longer destroyed
  - `sync.Pool`-based per-tile SoftwareRenderer and Pixmap reuse
  - Path conversion: `scene.Path` (float32) → `gg.Path` (float64) with tile offset
  - Brush/style conversion: `scene.Brush` → `gg.Paint` via non-deprecated `SetStroke()` API
  - Removed dead code: `fillPathOnTile`, `strokePathOnTile`, `drawLineOnTile`, `blendPixel`
  - Zero public API changes — `NewRenderer`, `Render`, `RenderDirty` unchanged
  - Orchestration preserved: TileGrid, WorkerPool, DirtyRegion, LayerCache untouched
  - 11 new pixel-level correctness tests

## [0.29.3] - 2026-02-23

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.16.11 → v0.16.12 (Vulkan debug object naming)
- gogpu v0.20.2 → v0.20.3 (examples/gogpu_integration)

## [0.29.2] - 2026-02-23

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.16.10 → v0.16.11 (Vulkan zero-extent swapchain fix)
- gogpu v0.20.1 → v0.20.2 (examples/gogpu_integration)

## [0.29.1] - 2026-02-22

### Dependencies

- wgpu v0.16.9 → v0.16.10
- naga v0.14.1 → v0.14.2
- gogpu v0.20.0 → v0.20.1 (examples/gogpu_integration)

## [0.29.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **GPU MSDF text pipeline** — `MSDFTextPipeline` renders text entirely on GPU using
  Multi-channel Signed Distance Field technique (Tier 4). WGSL fragment shader with
  standard Chlumsky/msdfgen `screenPxRange` formula produces resolution-independent
  anti-aliased text. 48px MSDF cells, pxRange=6, pixel-snapped quads, centered glyph
  content in atlas cells for correct positioning of all glyph aspect ratios.
- **Four-tier GPU render pipeline** — GPURenderSession upgraded from three-tier to
  four-tier: SDF (Tier 1) + Convex (Tier 2a) + Stencil+Cover (Tier 2b) + MSDF Text (Tier 4).
- **ggcanvas auto-registration** — `ggcanvas.Canvas` auto-registers with `App.TrackResource()`
  via duck-typed interface detection. No manual `defer canvas.Close()` or `OnClose` wiring
  needed — shutdown cleanup is automatic (LIFO order).
- **GPU stroke rendering** — `SDFAccelerator.StrokePath()` converts stroked paths to filled
  polygon outlines via stroke-expand-then-fill, then routes through the GPU convex polygon
  renderer. Eliminates CPU fallback for line strokes (checkbox checkmarks, radio outlines).

### Fixed
- **SceneBuilder.WithTransform invisible rendering** ([#116](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/116)) —
  tile-based renderer early-out used untransformed encoding bounds, causing content moved by
  transforms to be skipped. Bounds management moved from Encoding to Scene level with proper
  coordinate transforms. Clip paths no longer incorrectly expand encoding bounds.
- **GPU text pipeline resource leak** — destroy MSDFTextPipeline in SDFAccelerator.Close()
  (ShaderModule, PipelineLayout, Pipelines, DescriptorSetLayout, Sampler).
- **Surface dimension mismatch** — `GPURenderSession.RenderFrame()` uses surface dimensions
  for MSAA texture sizing and viewport uniforms in RenderDirect mode.
- **DX12 text disappearing after ~1 second** — text bind group was unconditionally destroyed
  and recreated every frame, freeing DX12 descriptor heap slots still referenced by in-flight
  GPU work. Changed to persistent bind group pattern (matching SDF) — create once, invalidate
  only when buffers are reallocated or atlas changes.

### Dependencies
- wgpu v0.16.6 → v0.16.9 (Metal presentDrawable fix, naga v0.14.1)
- naga v0.13.1 → v0.14.1 (HLSL row_major matrices for DX12, GLSL namedExpressions fix for GLES)
- gogpu v0.19.6 → v0.20.0 (ResourceTracker, automatic GPU resource cleanup)

## [0.28.6] - 2026-02-18

### Dependencies
- wgpu v0.16.5 → v0.16.6 (Metal debug logging, goffi v0.3.9)

## [0.28.5] - 2026-02-18

### Dependencies
- wgpu v0.16.4 → v0.16.5 (per-encoder command pools, fixes VkCommandBuffer crash)

## [0.28.4] - 2026-02-18

### Dependencies
- wgpu v0.16.3 → v0.16.4 (Vulkan timeline semaphore, FencePool, command buffer batch allocation, hot-path allocation optimization)
- naga v0.13.0 → v0.13.1 (SPIR-V OpArrayLength fix, −32% compiler allocations)
- gogpu v0.19.1 → v0.19.2 in examples (hot-path benchmarks)

## [0.28.3] - 2026-02-16

### Dependencies
- wgpu v0.16.1 → v0.16.2 (Metal autorelease pool LIFO fix for macOS Tahoe)

## [0.28.2] - 2026-02-15

### Changed

- **Persistent GPU buffers** — SDF/convex vertex buffers, uniform buffers, and bind
  groups survive across frames with grow-only reallocation (2x headroom). Reduces
  per-frame GPU overhead from ~14 buffer create/destroy cycles to zero in steady-state.
- **Fence-free surface submit** — surface rendering mode submits without fence wait;
  previous frame's command buffer freed at start of next frame (VSync guarantees GPU
  completion). Readback mode still uses fence. Eliminates 0.5-2ms/frame fence latency.
- **Vertex staging reuse** — CPU-side byte slices for SDF and convex vertex data reused
  across frames with grow-only strategy to reduce GC pressure.
- **Stencil buffer pooling** — pool-based approach for multi-path stencil buffer reuse.
- **GPU queue drain on shutdown** — no-op command buffer ensures GPU idle before resource
  destruction on shutdown and mode switch.
- **gogpu_integration example** — `CloseAccelerator` in `OnClose` handler with correct
  shutdown order; dependency update to gg v0.28.1.

### Fixed
- **golangci-lint config** — exclude `tmp/` directory from linting (gitignored debug files)

### Dependencies
- wgpu v0.16.0 → v0.16.1 (Vulkan framebuffer cache invalidation fix)
- gogpu v0.18.1 → v0.18.2, gg v0.28.1 → v0.28.2 (in examples)

## [0.28.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- **GPU readback compositing** — replaced `convertBGRAToRGBA` with Porter-Duff "over"
  compositing (`compositeBGRAOverRGBA`) for multi-flush correctness. GPU readback now
  correctly composites over existing canvas content instead of overwriting it.

### Changed

- **gogpu_integration example** — updated to event-driven rendering with `AnimationToken`,
  demonstrates three-state model (idle/animating/continuous) and Space key pause/resume

### Dependencies
- gogpu v0.18.0 → v0.18.1 (in examples)

## [0.28.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

#### Three-Tier GPU Render Pipeline

Complete GPU rendering pipeline with three tiers, unified under a single render pass.

##### Tier 1: SDF Render Pipeline
- **SDF render pipeline** — Signed Distance Field rendering for smooth primitive shapes
  - GPU-accelerated SDF for circles, ellipses, rectangles, rounded rectangles
  - Convexity detection for automatic tier selection
  - WGSL SDF shaders with analytic anti-aliasing

##### Tier 2a: Convex Fast-Path Renderer
- **Convex fast-path renderer** — optimized rendering for convex polygons
  - Direct vertex emission without tessellation overhead
  - Automatic convexity detection from path geometry
  - Single draw call per convex shape

##### Tier 2b: Stencil-Then-Cover (Arbitrary Paths)
- **Stencil-then-cover pipeline** — GPU rendering for arbitrary complex paths
  - `StencilRenderer` with MSAA + stencil texture management
  - Fan tessellator for converting paths to triangle fans
  - Stencil fill + cover render pipelines with WGSL shaders
  - EvenOdd fill rule support for stencil-then-cover (GG-GPU-010)
  - Integrated into `GPUAccelerator.FillPath`

##### Unified Architecture
- **Unified render pass** — all three tiers rendered in a single `BeginRenderPass`
  - Eliminates per-tier render pass overhead
  - Shared depth/stencil state across tiers
- **`RenderDirect()`** — zero-copy GPU surface rendering (GG-GPU-019)
  - Renders directly to GPU surface without intermediate buffer copies
  - `CloseAccelerator()` and GPU flush on `Context.Close()`
  - Lazy GPU initialization with surface target persistence between frames

#### ggcanvas Enhancements
- **`Canvas.Draw()` helper** — draws with `gg.Context` and marks dirty atomically,
  replacing manual `MarkDirty()` calls
- **Deferred texture destruction** on resize for DX12 stability

#### Observability
- **Structured logging via `log/slog`** — all GPU subsystem logging uses `slog`,
  silent by default (no output unless handler configured)

#### Testing
- **Raster package coverage** increased from 42.9% to 90.8%

### Fixed

- **TextureViewDescriptor wgpu-native compatibility** — all `CreateTextureView` calls now
  set explicit `Format`, `Dimension`, `Aspect`, and `MipLevelCount` instead of relying on
  zero-value defaults. Native Go backends handle zero defaults gracefully, but wgpu-native
  panics on `MipLevelCount=0`.
- **ggcanvas: DX12 texture disappearance during resize** — deferred texture
  destruction prevents descriptor heap use-after-free. Old texture is kept alive
  until after `WriteTexture` completes (GPU idle), then destroyed safely.
  Root cause: DX12 shader-visible sampler heap has a hard 2048-slot limit;
  leaked textures exhaust it, causing `CreateBindGroup` to fail silently
- **ggcanvas: removed debug logging** — alpha pixel counting and diagnostic
  `log.Printf` calls removed from `Flush()`
- **GPU readback pitch alignment** — aligned readback buffer pitch and added
  barrier after copy for correct GPU-to-CPU data transfer
- **GPU texture layout transition** — added texture layout transition before
  `CopyTextureToBuffer` to prevent validation errors
- **Surface target persistence** — keep surface target between frames, lazy GPU
  initialization prevents crashes on early frames
- **WGSL shader syntax** — removed stray semicolons from WGSL shader struct
  declarations
- **Raster X-bounds clipping** — added X-bounds clipping to analytic AA coverage
  computation, preventing out-of-bounds writes
- **gogpu integration exit crash** — example updated to use `App.OnClose()` for canvas
  cleanup, preventing Vulkan validation errors when GPU resources were destroyed after device
- **Linter warnings** resolved in raster and ggcanvas packages

### Changed

- **GPU architecture refactored** — deleted compute pipeline legacy code, retained
  render pipeline only
- **Examples updated** — `gpu` and `gogpu_integration` examples rewritten for
  three-tier rendering architecture with GLES backend support

### Dependencies
- wgpu v0.15.0 → v0.16.0
- naga v0.12.0 → v0.13.0
- gogpu v0.17.0 → v0.18.0 (in examples)

## [0.27.1] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Text rendering over GPU shapes** — `DrawString` and `DrawStringAnchored` now flush pending GPU accelerator batch before drawing text, preventing GPU-rendered shapes (e.g., rounded rect backgrounds) from overwriting previously drawn text

## [0.27.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **SDF Accelerator** — Signed Distance Field rendering for smooth shapes
  - `SDFAccelerator` — CPU SDF for circles, ellipses, rectangles, rounded rectangles
  - `DetectShape(path)` — auto-detects circle (4 cubics with kappa), rect, rrect from path elements
  - `Context.Fill()/Stroke()` tries accelerator first, falls back to `SoftwareRenderer`
  - Register via `gg.RegisterAccelerator(&gg.SDFAccelerator{})`
  - ~30% smoother edges compared to area-based rasterizer
- **GPU SDF compute pipeline** — GPU-accelerated SDF via wgpu HAL
  - `NativeSDFAccelerator` with DeviceProvider integration for GPU device sharing
  - WGSL compute shaders (`sdf_batch.wgsl`) for batch SDF rendering
  - Multi-pass dispatch workaround for naga loop iteration bug
  - GPU → CPU buffer readback via `hal.Queue.ReadBuffer`
- **GPUAccelerator interface** extended with `FillPath`, `StrokePath` rendering methods and `CanAccelerate` shape detection
- **`gpu/` public registration package** (ADR-009) — opt-in GPU acceleration via `import _ "github.com/gogpu/gg/gpu"`
- **SDF example** (`examples/sdf/`) — demonstrates SDF accelerator with filled and stroked shapes

### Changed

- **Architecture:** `internal/native` renamed to `internal/gpu` for clarity
- **Dependencies updated:**
  - gpucontext v0.8.0 → v0.9.0
  - naga v0.11.0 → v0.12.0
  - wgpu v0.13.2 → v0.15.0
  - golang.org/x/image v0.35.0 → v0.36.0
  - golang.org/x/text v0.33.0 → v0.34.0

- WGSL SDF shaders rewritten to work around naga SPIR-V codegen bugs (5 bugs documented)
- Flush pending GPU shapes before pixel readback

## [0.26.1] - 2026-02-07

### Changed

- **naga** dependency updated v0.10.0 → v0.11.0 — fixes SPIR-V `if/else` GPU hang, adds 55 new WGSL built-in functions
- **wgpu** dependency updated v0.13.1 → v0.13.2
- **gogpu_integration example** — updated minimum gogpu version to v0.15.7+

## [0.26.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **GPUAccelerator interface** — optional GPU acceleration with transparent CPU fallback
  - `RegisterAccelerator()` for opt-in GPU via blank import pattern
  - `ErrFallbackToCPU` sentinel error for graceful degradation
  - `AcceleratedOp` bitfield for capability checking
  - Zero overhead (~17ns) when no GPU registered

### Changed

- **Architecture: CPU raster is core, GPU is optional accelerator**
  - CPU rasterization types extracted to `internal/raster` package
  - Native rendering pipeline moved to `internal/native` package
  - `SoftwareRenderer` uses `internal/raster` directly (no backend abstraction)
  - `cache`, `gpucore` packages moved to `internal/` (implementation details)

### Removed

- **`backend/` package** — RenderBackend interface, registry pattern, SoftwareBackend wrapper
- **`backend/rust/`** — dead Rust FFI backend code (5 files)
- **`internal/raster/` (legacy)** — old supersampled AA rasterizer (14 files, replaced by analytic AA)
- **`go-webgpu/webgpu`** dependency — no longer needed
- **`go-webgpu/goffi`** dependency — no longer needed

## [0.25.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Vello tile-based analytic anti-aliasing rasterizer**
  - Port of vello_shaders CPU fine rasterizer (`fine.rs`) to Go
  - 16x16 tile binning with DDA-based segment distribution
  - Analytic trapezoidal area coverage per pixel (no supersampling)

  - VelloLine float pipeline: bypasses fixed-point quantization (FDot6/FDot16) for improved accuracy
  - Bottom-of-circle artifact improved from alpha=191 to alpha=248
  - NonZero and EvenOdd fill rules
  - Golden test infrastructure with 7 test shapes and reference image comparison
  - Research documentation with detailed algorithm analysis

### Changed

- **Examples:** update `gogpu_integration` dependencies to gg v0.24.1, gogpu v0.15.5

### Planned for v1.0.0
- API Review and cleanup
- Comprehensive documentation
- Performance benchmarks

## [0.24.1] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- **Alpha compositing: fix dark halos around anti-aliased shapes**
  - Root cause: mixed alpha conventions — `FillSpanBlend` stored premultiplied, `BlendPixelAlpha` stored straight, causing double-premultiplication
  - Standardized on **premultiplied alpha** (industry standard: tiny-skia, Ebitengine, vello, femtovg, Cairo, SDL)
  - `Pixmap`: store premultiplied RGBA in `SetPixel`, `Clear`, `FillSpan`
  - `Pixmap`: un-premultiply in `GetPixel` for public API
  - `Pixmap.At()` returns `color.RGBA` (premultiplied), `ColorModel()` → `color.RGBAModel`
  - Software renderer: fix all 4 `BlendPixelAlpha` locations to premultiplied source-over
  - `FromColor()`: correctly un-premultiply Go's `color.Color.RGBA()` output
  - `ColorMatrixFilter`: un-premultiply before matrix transform, re-premultiply after
  - `ggcanvas`: mark textures as premultiplied via `SetPremultiplied(true)`
  - Requires gogpu v0.15.5+ for correct GPU compositing with `BlendFactorOne`
- **Examples:** fix hardcoded output paths in `clipping` and `images` examples ([#85](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/pull/85))
  - Both used `examples/*/output.png` which only worked from repo root
  - Now use `output.png` — `go run .` works from example directory
- **gogpu_integration example:** update dependency versions to gg v0.24.0 / gogpu v0.15.4
- **Cleanup:** remove stale `rect_debug/` directory (debug artifacts from rasterizer experiments)

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **GoTextShaper: HarfBuzz-level text shaping** ([#78](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/78))
  - `GoTextShaper` wraps go-text/typesetting's HarfBuzz engine
  - Supports ligatures, kerning, contextual alternates, complex scripts
  - Opt-in via `text.SetShaper(text.NewGoTextShaper())`
  - Thread-safe: `sync.Pool` for HarfBuzz shapers, cached `font.Font` (read-only)
  - Fixed concurrency bug: `font.Face` and `HarfbuzzShaper` are not goroutine-safe
  - Uses `font.Font` cache (thread-safe) + per-call `font.NewFace()` (lightweight)
  - Uses deprecated `ClusterIndex` replaced with `TextIndex()`
  - 20+ tests including concurrency, kerning, ligatures, cache management
  - 3 benchmarks (short, standard, long text)

- **WebP image format support** ([#77](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/77))
  - `LoadWebP()`, `DecodeWebP()` for explicit WebP decoding
  - `LoadImage()` and `LoadImageFromBytes()` auto-detect WebP via registered decoder
  - Uses `golang.org/x/image/webp` (already in go.mod)

- **gogpu_integration example** — moved from `gogpu/examples/gg_integration/` to fix inverted dependency (gogpu no longer depends on gg)
  - Isolated Go module with own `go.mod`
  - Demonstrates gg + gogpu rendering via ggcanvas

### Fixed

- **Custom Pattern implementations always render black** ([#75](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/75))
  - Root cause 1: `getColorFromPaint()` only handled `*SolidPattern`, returned Black for everything else
  - Root cause 2: `SetFillPattern()`/`SetStrokePattern()` didn't sync `paint.Brush`, breaking `ColorAt()` precedence
  - Fix: New `painterPixmapAdapter` samples `paint.ColorAt(x,y)` per-pixel for non-solid paints
  - Solid paints still use fast single-color path (no performance regression)
  - New `Painter` interface (`painter.go`) for future span-based optimizations

- **ggcanvas texture updates silently failing** ([#79](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/79))
  - Root cause: local `textureUpdater` interface expected `UpdateData(data []byte)` (no error return), but `gogpu.Texture.UpdateData` returns `error` — type assertion failed silently
  - Fix: use shared `gpucontext.TextureUpdater` interface with proper error handling
  - Added auto-dirty in `RenderToEx()` — calling `RenderTo` now always uploads current content
  - Compile-time interface check for mock in tests

## [0.23.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added

#### Recording System for Vector Export (ARCH-011)

## [0.21.2] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **Hairline rendering** (BUG-003, [#56](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/56))
  - Dual-path stroke rendering following tiny-skia/Skia pattern
  - Thin strokes (width <= 1px after transform) use direct hairline rendering
  - Fixed-point arithmetic (FDot6/FDot16) for sub-pixel precision
  - +0.5 centering fix for correct pixel distribution on integer coordinates
  - Line cap support (butt, round, square) for hairlines

- **Transform-aware stroke system**
  - `Matrix.ScaleFactor()` — extracts max scale from transform matrix
  - `Paint.TransformScale` — passes transform info to renderer
  - `Dash.Scale()` — scales dash pattern by transform (Cairo/Skia convention)

### Fixed

- **Thin dashed strokes render as disconnected pixels** ([#56](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/56))
  - Root cause 1: Stroke expansion creates paths too thin for proper coverage
  - Solution: Hairline rendering for strokes ≤1px (after transform)

- **Stroke expansion artifacts with scale > 1** ([#56](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/56))
  - Root cause 2: `finish()` computed wrong normal for end cap from point difference
  - Solution: Save `lastNorm` in `doLine()`, use it for end cap (tiny-skia pattern)
  - Eliminates horizontal stripes inside dash segments at scale > 1

### New Files

- `internal/raster/hairline_aa.go` — Core AA hairline algorithm
- `internal/raster/hairline_blitter.go` — Hairline blitter interface
- `internal/raster/hairline_caps.go` — Line cap handling

## [0.21.1] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- **Dashed strokes with scale** (BUG-002, [#54](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/54))
  - Root cause: `path.Flatten()` lost subpath boundaries, causing rasterizer to create incorrect "connecting edges" between separate subpaths
  - Solution: New `path.EdgeIter` following tiny-skia pattern — iterates over edges directly without creating inter-subpath connections
  - Added `raster.FillAAFromEdges()` for correct edge-based rasterization

- **Advanced Blend** — 11 separable modes (Screen, Overlay, Darken, Lighten, ColorDodge, ColorBurn, HardLight, SoftLight, Difference, Exclusion, Multiply)
- **Layer System** — Isolated drawing surfaces with compositing on pop

#### Public API
- **DrawImage(img, x, y)** — Draw image at position
- **DrawImageEx(img, opts)** — Draw with transform, opacity, blend mode
- **CreateImagePattern** — Create pattern for fills
- **Clip()** — Clip to current path
- **ClipPreserve()** — Clip keeping path
- **ClipRect(x, y, w, h)** — Fast rectangular clipping
- **ResetClip()** — Clear clipping region

#### Examples
- `examples/images/` — Image loading and drawing demo
- `examples/clipping/` — Clipping API demonstration

### Testing

- **MeasureString** — Accurate text measurement
- **LoadFontFace** — Convenience method for simple cases

#### Font Composition
- **MultiFace** — Font fallback chain for emoji/multi-language
- **FilteredFace** — Unicode range restriction (16 predefined ranges)
- Common ranges: BasicLatin, Cyrillic, CJK, Emoji, and more

#### Performance
- **LRU Cache** — Generic cache with soft limit eviction
- **RuneToBoolMap** — Bit-packed glyph presence cache (375x memory savings)
- **iter.Seq[Glyph]** — Go 1.25+ zero-allocation iterators

#### Architecture
- **FontParser interface** — Pluggable font parsing backends
- **golang.org/x/image** — Default parser implementation
- Copy protection using Ebitengine pattern
